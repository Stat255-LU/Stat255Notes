    "text": "Preface\nThese notes serve as the primary textual resource for Stat 255: Statistics for Data Science at Lawrence University.\nWhat is this course about?\nStat 255 provides an introduction to essential statistical tasks including modeling, inference, prediction, and computation. The course employs a modern approach, intended to equip students with skills needed for working with today’s complex data. Traditional concepts, like interval estimation and hypothesis testing, are introduced through the lens of multivariate models and simulation. Data computation in R plays a central role throughout the course.\nThe course’s overarching learning outcomes are:\n\nVisualize and wrangle data using statistical software R.\n\nBuild and assess multivariate models to predict future outcomes.\n\nUse statistics from samples to draw inferences about larger populations or processes.\n\nQuantify uncertainty associated with estimates and predictions.\n\nExplain the assumptions associated with statistical models, and evaluate whether these assumptions are reasonably satisfied in context.\n\nWrite reproducible analyses, using statistical software.\n\nMake ethical decisions based on data.\n\nMore specific learning tasks, related to these outcomes are provided in each chapter.\nWho is this course intended for?\nThis course is intended for students who are interested in learning statistical modeling and data computation skills that might prove useful in further courses, research, or career.\nStat 255 can serve as either:\n\na first course in statistics for students with a strong quantitative background, typically including calculus.\na second course in statistics, building on introductory topics taught in courses like Lawrence’s Stat 107: Principles of Statistics or AP Statistics.\n\nAt Lawrence, this course is required for the statistics track of the mathematics major, the economics and mathematics-economics majors, the business analytics track of the business and entrepreneurship major, and the statistics and data science minor. It also satisfies the statistics requirement for several other majors and minors.\nThe prerequisite for the course is either 1) a prior college-level course in statistics (i.e. STAT 107, BIOL 170 or 280, ANTH 207, AP Stats) OR 2) Calculus. (Math 140, AP Calculus, or equivalent).\nThe course does not assume any prior knowledge of statistics, but does move more rapidly than a typical introductory statistics course. Students engage rigorously in statistical thinking and computation, intended to equip them with essential skills for further study in statistics and data science.",

    "text": "1.2 Summary Statistics\n\n1.2.1 Measures of Center\nCommon ways to characterize the center of a distribution include mean, median, and mode.\nFor a set of \\(n\\) values \\(y_i, \\ldots, y_n\\):\n\nmean (\\(\\bar{y}\\)) represents the numerical average and is calculated by \\(\\bar{y} =\\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\).\nmedian represents the middle number when the values are arranged from least to greatest. If there are an even number of values in the dataset, then the median is given by the average of the middle two numbers.\n\nThe median of the upper half of the values is called the upper (or 3rd) quartile. This represents the 75th percentile in the distribution.\nThe median of the lower half of the values is called the lower (or 1st) quartile. This represents the 25th percentile in the distribution.\n\nmode is the most frequently occurring number in the data.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Measures of Spread\nCommon ways of measuring the amount of spread, or variability, in a variable include:\n\nrange: the difference between the maximum and minimum values\ninterquartile range: the difference between the upper and lower quartiles (i.e. the range of the middle 50% of the values).\nstandard deviation (\\(s\\)): standard deviation is approximately the average deviation between an observation and the mean. It is calculated by\n\\(s =\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\\).\nThe square of the standard deviation, called the variance is denoted \\(s^2\\).\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Calcularing Summary Statistics in R\nLet’s calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation, in prices.\n\nHouses_Summary &lt;- Houses |&gt; summarize(Mean_Price = mean(price, na.rm=TRUE), \n                                          Median_Price = median(price, na.rm=TRUE), \n                                          StDev_Price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                          Number_of_Houses = n()) \nHouses_Summary\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  Mean_Price Median_Price StDev_Price Number_of_Houses\n       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1       710.         458.        679.              200\n\n\nNotes:\n1. The n() command calculates the number of observations.\n2. The na.rm=TRUE command removes missing values, so that summary statistics can be calculated. It’s not needed here, since this dataset doesn’t include missing values, but if the dataset does include missing values, you will need to include this, in order to do the calculation.\nThe kable() function in the knitr() package creates tables with professional appearance.\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(Houses_Summary)\n\n\n\n\nMean_Price\nMedian_Price\nStDev_Price\nNumber_of_Houses\n\n\n\n\n710.1975\n457.8125\n678.6034\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Grouped Summaries\ngroup_by()\nThe group_by() command allows us to calculate summary statistics, with the data broken down by by category.We’ll compare waterfront houses to non-waterfront houses.\n\nHouses_Grouped_Summary &lt;- Houses |&gt; group_by(waterfront) |&gt; \n                                      summarize(Mean_Price = mean(price, na.rm=TRUE),\n                                                Median_Price = median(price, na.rm=TRUE), \n                                                StDev_Price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                                Number_of_Houses = n()) \nkable(Houses_Grouped_Summary)\n\n\n\n\nwaterfront\nMean_Price\nMedian_Price\nStDev_Price\nNumber_of_Houses\n\n\n\n\nNo\n552.6609\n430\n409.7904\n175\n\n\nYes\n1812.9540\n1700\n1073.8480\n25\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that waterfront house tend to be more expensive, on average, and also have more variability (higher standard deviation) in price than non-waterfront houses.",

The middle 50% of observations are contained in the “box”, with the upper and lower 25% of the observations in each tail.\nGeneral Template for Boxplot\n\nggplot(data=DatasetName, aes(x=CategoricalVariable, \n                             y=QuantitativeVariable)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  xlab(\"Variable Name\") + ylab(\"Variable Name\") \n\nYou can make the plot horizontal by adding + coordflip(). You can turn the axis text vertical by adding theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)).\nBoxplot Comparing Price by Waterfront Status\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=waterfront, y=price)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  ggtitle(\"House Price by Waterfront Status\") + \n  xlab(\"Waterfront\") + ylab(\"Price (in thousands)\") + coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor houses not on the waterfront, the median price is about $400,000, and the middle 50% of prices range from about $300,000 to $700,000.\nFor waterfront houses, the median price is about $1,700,000, and the middle 50% of prices range from about $900,000 to $2,200,000.\n\n\n1.3.4 Violin Plot\nViolin plots are an alternative to boxplots. The width of the violin tells us the density of observations in a given range.\nGeneral Template for Violin Plot\n\nggplot(data=DatasetName, aes(x=CategoricalVariable, y=QuantitativeVariable, \n                             fill=CategoricalVariable)) + \n  geom_violin() + \n  ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  xlab(\"Variable Name\") + ylab(\"Variable Name\") \n\nViolin Plot Comparing Prices by Waterfront\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=waterfront, y=price, fill=waterfront)) + \n  geom_violin() + \n  ggtitle(\"Price by Waterfront Status\") + \n  xlab(\"Waterfront\") + ylab(\"Price (in thousands)\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we see that houses on the waterfront tend to be more expensive than those not on the waterfront, and have a wider range in prices.\n\n\n1.3.5 Scatterplot\nScatterplots are used to visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables.\nScatterplot Template\n\nggplot(data=DatasetName, aes(x=QuantitativeVariable, y=QuantitativeVariable)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  ylab(\"Axis Label\") + \n  xlab(\"Axis Label\")\n\nScatterplot Comparing Price and Square Feet of Living Space\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Price and Living Space\") + \n  ylab(\"Price (in thousands)\") + \n  xlab(\"Living Space in sq. ft. \")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is an upward trend, indicating that houses with more living space tend to, on average, be higher priced than those with less living space. The relationship appears to be roughly linear, though there might be some curvature, as living space gets very large. There are some exceptions to this trend, most notably a house with more than 7,000 square feet, priced over $1,500,000.\nWe can also add color, size, and shape to the scatterplot to display information about other variables.\nWe’ll use color to illustrate whether the house is on the waterfront, and size to represent the square footage of the entire lot (including the yard and the house).\n\nggplot(data=Houses, \n       aes(x=sqft_living, y=price, color=waterfront, size=sqft_lot)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Price of King County Houses\") + \n  ylab(\"Price (in thousands)\") + \n  xlab(\"Living Space in sq. ft. \")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that many of the largest and most expensive houses are on the waterfront.\n\n\n1.3.6 Bar Graph\nBar graphs can be used to visualize one or more categorical variables. A bar graph is similar to a histogram, in that the y-axis again displays frequency, but the x-axis displays categories, instead of ranges of values.\nBar Graph Template\n\nggplot(data=DatasetName, aes(x=CategoricalVariable)) + \n  geom_bar(fill=\"colorchoice\",color=\"colorchoice\")  + \n  ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  xlab(\"Variable Name\") + \n  ylab(\"Frequency\") \n\nBar Graph by Condition\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=condition)) + \n  geom_bar(fill=\"lightblue\",color=\"white\")  + \n  ggtitle(\"Number of Houses by Condition\") + \n  xlab(\"Condition\") + \n  ylab(\"Frequency\") +   \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the majority of houses are in average or below condition. Some are in good or very good condition, while a few are in very good condition.\n\n\n1.3.7 Stacked and Side-by-Side Bar Graphs\nStacked Bar Graph Template\n\nggplot(data = DatasetName, mapping = aes(x = CategoricalVariable1, \n                                         fill = CategoricalVariable2)) +\n    stat_count(position=\"fill\")  +\n  theme_bw() + ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  xlab(\"Variable 1\") + \n  ylab(\"Proportion of Variable 2\") +   \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) \n\nStacked Bar Graph Example\nThe stat_count(position=\"fill\") command creates a stacked bar graph, comparing two categorical variables. Let’s explore whether waterfront status is related to condition.\n\nggplot(data = Houses, mapping = aes(x = waterfront, fill = condition)) +\n    stat_count(position=\"fill\")  +\n  theme_bw() + ggtitle(\"Condition by Waterfront Status\") + \n  xlab(\"Waterfront Status\") + \n  ylab(\"Condition\") +   \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that a slightly higher proportion of waterfront houses are in good or very condition than non-waterfront houses.\nSide-by-side Bar Graph Template\nWe can create a side-by-side bar graph, using position=dodge.\n\nggplot(data = DatasetName, mapping = aes(x = CategoricalVariable1, \n                                         fill = CategoricalVariable2)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Plot Title\") + \n  xlab(\"Genre\") + \n  ylab(\"Frequency\") \n\nSide-by-side Bar Graph Example\n\nggplot(data = Houses, mapping = aes(x = waterfront, fill = condition)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Condition by Waterfront Status\") + \n  xlab(\"Waterfront Status\") + \n  ylab(\"Condition\") +   \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe side by side bar graph conveys similar information to the stacked bar graph. It has the advantage of letting us see how many houses are in each category. We can tell that there are far more non-waterfront houses than waterfront ones. On the other hand, it is harder to compare the ratio of average, good, and very good houses with a side-by-side bar graph than it is with a stacked bar graph.\n\n\n1.3.8 Correlation Plot\nCorrelation plots can be used to visualize relationships between quantitative variables. Correlation is a number between -1 and 1, describing the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Variables with strong positive correlations will have correlation close to +1, while variables with strong negative correlations will have correlations close to -1. Variables with little to no relationship will have correlation close to 0.\nThe cor() function calculates correlations between quantitative variables. We’ll use select_if to select only numeric variables. The `use=“complete.obs” command tells R to ignore observations with missing data.\n\ncor(select_if(Houses, is.numeric), use=\"complete.obs\") |&gt; round(2)\n\n               ID price sqft_living sqft_lot bedrooms bathrooms yr_built   age\nID           1.00  0.05        0.06     0.02    -0.07      0.11     0.21 -0.21\nprice        0.05  1.00        0.79     0.16     0.28      0.60     0.09 -0.09\nsqft_living  0.06  0.79        1.00     0.36     0.47      0.72     0.27 -0.27\nsqft_lot     0.02  0.16        0.36     1.00     0.14      0.17     0.00  0.00\nbedrooms    -0.07  0.28        0.47     0.14     1.00      0.48     0.07 -0.07\nbathrooms    0.11  0.60        0.72     0.17     0.48      1.00     0.42 -0.42\nyr_built     0.21  0.09        0.27     0.00     0.07      0.42     1.00 -1.00\nage         -0.21 -0.09       -0.27     0.00    -0.07     -0.42    -1.00  1.00\n\n\nThe corrplot() function in the corrplot() package provides a visualization of the correlations. Larger, thicker circles indicate stronger correlations.\n\nlibrary(corrplot)\nCorr &lt;- cor(select_if(Houses, is.numeric), use=\"complete.obs\")\ncorrplot(Corr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that price has a strong positive correlation with square feet of living space, and is also positively correlated with number of bedrooms. Living space, bedrooms, and bathrooms are also positively correlated, which makes sense, since we would expect bigger houses to have more bedrooms and bathrooms. Price does not show much correlation with the other variables. We notice that square feet of living space is negatively correlated with age, which means older houses tend to be smaller than newer ones. Not surprisingly, age is very strongly correlated with year built.\n\n\n1.3.9 Scatterplot Matrix\nA scatterplot matrix is a grid of plots. It can be created using the ggpairs() function in the GGally package.\nThe scatterplot matrix shows us:\n\nAlong the diagonal are density plots for quantitative variables, or bar graphs for categorical variables, showing the distribution of each variable.\n\nUnder the diagonal are plots showing the relationships between the variables in the corresponding row and column. Scatterplots are used when both variables are quantitative, bar graphs are used when both variables are categorical, and boxplots are used when one variable is categorical, and the other is quantitative.\n\nAbove the diagonal are correlations between quantitative variables.\n\nIncluding too many variables can make these hard to read, so it’s a good idea to use select to narrow down the number of variables.\n\nlibrary(GGally)\nggpairs(Houses |&gt; select(price, sqft_living, condition, age))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot matrix is useful for helping us notice key trends in our data. However, the plot can hard to read as it is quite dense, especially when there are a large number of variables. These can help us look for trends from a distance, but we should then focus in on more specific plots.",

    "text": "2.1 Fitting Models to Data\n\n2.1.1 Terminology\nIn this section, we’ll use statistical models to predict the prices of houses in King County, WA.\nIn a statistical model,\n\nThe variable we are trying to predict (price) is called the response variable (denoted \\(Y\\)).\nVariable(s) we use to help us make the prediction is(are) called explanatory variables (denoted \\(X\\)). These are also referred to as predictor variables or covariates.\n\nIn this section, we’ll attempt to predict the price of a house, using information about its size (in square feet), and whether or not it is on the waterfront. The price is our response variable, while size and waterfront location are explanatory variables.\n\nCategorical variables are variables that take on groups or categories, rather than numeric values, for example, whether or not the house is on the waterfront.\nQuantitative variables take on meaningful numeric values, for example the number of square feet in the house.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Quantitative Explanatory Variable\nWe’ll first predict the price of the house, using the number of square feet of living space as our explanatory variable.\nA model with a single quantitative explanatory variable is called a simple linear regression (SLR) model.\nWe’ll assume that price changes linearly with square feet, and fit a trend line to the data.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"Price and Living Space\") + \n  ylab(\"Price\") + \n  xlab(\"Living Space in sq. ft. \") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}\n\\]\nThe symbol over the response variable (Price) is read as “hat”, and means “predicted price”.\nWe fit the model in R, using the lm (linear model) command. The output gives the estimates of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\).\n\nM_House_price_sqft &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~sqft_living)\nM_House_price_sqft\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ sqft_living, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  sqft_living  \n  -364.8497       0.4641  \n\n\nThe estimates are \\(b_0=\\) -364.85 and \\(b_1=\\) 0.46.\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = -364.85  + 0.46\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}\n\\]\nInterpretations\nThe intercept \\(b_0\\) represents the expected (or average) value of the response variable, when the explanatory variable is equal to 0. This is not always a meaningful interpretation in context.\nThe slope \\(b_1\\) represents the expected (or average) change in the response variable for each one-unit increase in the explanatory variable.\n\nOn average, a house with 0 square feet is expected to cost -365 thousand dollars. This is not a sensible interpretation, as there are no houses with 0 square feet.\nFor each additional square foot in living space, the price of the house is expected to increase by 0.46 thousand dollars (or $460).\n\n\nSince a 1 square ft. increase is very small, it makes more sense to give the interpretation in terms of a 100-square foot increase.

We can also build a model that uses both of these variables at the same time.\nA model with two or more explanatory variables is called a multiple regression model.\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft} + b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront}\n\\]\nFor a house not on the waterfront, the \\(\\text{Waterfront} = 0\\) so the model equation is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = b_0  + b_1\\text{Sq. Ft}\n\\]\nFor a house on the waterfront, \\(\\text{Waterfront} = 1\\), so the model equation is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = (b_0 + b_2) + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft}\n\\]\nNotice that the slope is the same, regardless of whether the house is on the waterfront (\\(b_1\\)). The intercept, however, is different (\\(b_0\\) for houses not on the waterfront, and \\(b_0 + b_2\\) for houses on the waterfront). Thus, the model assumes that price increases at the same rate, with respect to square feet, regardless of whether or not it is on the waterfront, but allows the predicted price for a waterfront house to differ from a non-waterfront house of the same size.\nThe geom_parallel_slopes(se=FALSE) command adds regression lines with a common slope. This function is part of the moderndive R package.\n\nPlot_House_price_sqft_wf &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price, color=waterfront)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_bw() + \n  geom_parallel_slopes(se=FALSE) \n\nPlot_House_price_sqft_wf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fit the model in R.\n\nM_House_price_sqft_wf &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~sqft_living+waterfront)\nM_House_price_sqft_wf\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ sqft_living + waterfront, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n  (Intercept)    sqft_living  waterfrontYes  \n    -269.5118         0.3819       760.2965  \n\n\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = -269.51 + 0.38\\times\\text{Sq. Ft} + 760.3\\times\\text{Waterfront}\n\\]\nInterpretations\nThe intercept \\(b_0\\) represents the expected (or average) value of the response variable, when all quantitative explanatory variables are equal to 0, and all categorical variables are in the “baseline” category. This interpretation is not always sensible.\nWe interpret coefficients \\(b_j\\) for categorical or quantitative variables, the same way we would in a regression model with only one variable, but we need to state that all other explanatory variables are being held constant.\n\nOn average, a house that is not on the waterfront with 0 square feet is expected to cost -269.51 thousand dollars. This is not a sensible interpretation, since there are no houses with 0 square feet.\n\nFor each 1-square foot increase in size, the price of a house is expected to increase by 0.38 thousand (or 380) dollars, assuming waterfront status is the same. Equivalently, for each 100-square foot increase in size, the price of a house is expected to increase by 38 thousand dollars, assuming waterfront status is the same.\nOn average, a house on the waterfront is expected to cost 760.3 thousand dollars more than a house that is not on the waterfront, assuming square footage is the same.\n\nQuestion for thought: Notice that the estimated difference in price between waterfront and non-waterfront houses, after accounting for size, is 760.3, which is less than the estimated difference when we did not account for size, which was 1260.29. Why is this? Hint: look at the scatterplot displaying house price, size, and waterfront status.\nPrediction\nThe predicted price of a 2,000 square foot house on the waterfront is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = -269.51 + 0.38\\times2000 + 760.3\\times1 = 1254.66{ \\text{ thousand (or 1.25 million)}}\n\\]\nThe predicted price of a 2,000 square foot house not on the waterfront is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = -269.51 + 0.38\\times2000 = 494.37{ \\text{ thousand}}\n\\]\nCalculations in R:\n\npredict(M_House_price_sqft_wf, newdata=data.frame(waterfront=\"Yes\", sqft_living=2000))\n\n       1 \n1254.665 \n\n\n\npredict(M_House_price_sqft_wf, newdata=data.frame(waterfront=\"No\", sqft_living=2000))\n\n       1 \n494.3681 \n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 No Explanatory Variable\nFinally, we’ll consider a model that makes use of no explanatory variables at all.

    "text": "2.2 Variability Explained by a Model\nWe’ve seen four different models for predicting house price. We want to be able to quantify how well the models are predicting prices, and determine which best explain variability in price.\nOf course we won’t know the price of the house we are trying to predict, so we can’t be sure how close or far our prediction is. We do, however, know the prices of the original 200 houses in our dataset. We can assess the models by measuring how far the actual prices of the 200 houses differ from the predicted (mean) price, and by calculating the proportion of total variation in sale price explained by each model.\n\n2.2.1 Total Variability\nLet’s start with our most basic model, which uses no explanatory variables and predicts the price of each simply using the average of all houses in the dataset.\nWe measure the total variability in the response variable by calculating the square difference between each individual response value and the overall average. This quantity is called the total sum of squares (SST).\n\\[\n\\text{SST} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\\]\nThe plot below shows a horizontal line at the mean sale price (710.2 thousand). The points represent prices of individual houses, and the red lines represent the differences between the price of each house and the overall average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the majority of the houses are priced below the overall average, but some houses are much more expensive than average. A property of averages is that the positive and negative differences from the average will always cancel out and sum to zero.\nThe first three houses in the dataset are shown below.\n\nFirst3Houses &lt;- Houses %&gt;% select(ID, price, waterfront, sqft_living) %&gt;% head(3)\nkable(First3Houses)\n\n\n\n\nID\nprice\nwaterfront\nsqft_living\n\n\n\n\n90\n335.0\nNo\n1030\n\n\n126\n1450.0\nNo\n2750\n\n\n300\n267.5\nNo\n1590\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{SST} & = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 \\\\\n& = (335- 710)^2 + (1450- 710)^2 + (1450- 710)^2 + \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe could calculate SST by hand for small datasets. For larger datasets, we’ll use R to perform the calculation.\n\nmeanprice &lt;- mean(Houses$price)  #calculate mean price\nSST &lt;- sum((Houses$price - meanprice)^2)  ## calculate SST\nSST\n\n[1] 91640004\n\n\nOr, equivalently,\n\nSST_M_House_price &lt;- sum((M_House_price_0$resid)^2)\nSST_M_House_price\n\n[1] 91640004\n\n\nBy itself, the size of SST does not have much meaning. We cannot say whether a SST value like the one we see here is large or small, since it depends on the size and scale of the variable being measured. An SST value that is very large in one context might be very small in another.\nSST does, however, give us a baseline measure of the total variability in the response variable. We’ll assess the performance of a model with a given explanatory variable by measuring how much of this variability the model accounts for.\n\n\n2.2.2 Residuals\nNow let’s consider our model that uses the size of the house in square feet as the explanatory variable. The figure on the left shows difference between actual and predicted prices, using this linear model. We compare the size of the differences to those resulting from the basic model that does not use any explanatory variables, and predicts each price using the overall average (shown on the right).\n\nP_Resid_M_House_price_sqft &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(x = sqft_living, y = price)) +  geom_point() +\n                geom_segment(aes(xend = sqft_living, yend = M_House_price_sqft$fitted.values), color=\"red\") +\n                geom_point(aes(y = M_House_price_sqft$fitted.values), shape = 1) +\n                stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + ylim(c(0,5000)) +\n                theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the red lines are shorter in the figure on the left, indicating the predictions are closer to the actual values.\nThe difference between the actual and predicted values is called the residual. The residual for the \\(ith\\) case is\n\\[\nr_i = (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)\n\\]\nWe’ll calculate the residuals for the first three houses in the dataset, shown below.\n\nkable(First3Houses)\n\n\n\n\nID\nprice\nwaterfront\nsqft_living\n\n\n\n\n90\n335.0\nNo\n1030\n\n\n126\n1450.0\nNo\n2750\n\n\n300\n267.5\nNo\n1590\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = -364.85 + 0.46\\times \\text{Sq. Ft}\n\\]\nThe predicted prices for these three houses are:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}_1} = -364.85 + 0.46\\times 1030 = 113.2 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}_2} = -364.85 + 0.46\\times 2750 = 911.5 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}_3} = -364.85 + 0.46\\times 1590 = 373.1 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\nTo calculate the residuals, we subtract the predicted price from the actual price.\n\\[r_1 = y_1-\\hat{y}_1 = 335 - 113.2 = 222  \\text{ thousand dollars}\\]\n\\[r_2 = y_2-\\hat{y}_2 = 1450 - 911.5 = 538 \\text{ thousand dollars}\\]\n\\[r_3 = y_3-\\hat{y}_2 = 267.5 - 373.1 = -106 \\text{ thousand dollars}\\]\nPositive residuals indicate that the house sold for more than the model predicted, while negative residuals mean the house sold for less than the model predicted.\nThe predicted values and residuals from a model can be calculated automatically in R. The predicted values and residuals for the first 3 houses are shown below.\n\nPredicted &lt;- predict(M_House_price_sqft)\nhead(Predicted, 3)\n\n       1        2        3 \n113.2049 911.5096 373.1180 \n\n\n\nResidual &lt;- M_House_price_sqft$residuals\nhead(Residual, 3)\n\n        1         2         3 \n 221.7951  538.4904 -105.6180 \n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Variability Explained by Sq. Ft. Model\nThe sum of squared residuals (SSR) measures the amount of unexplained variability in the response variable after accounting for all explanatory variables in the model.\n\\[\n\\text{SSR} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2.  \n\\]\nNote that SSR is similar to SST, except we subtract the model’s predicted values, rather than the overall average. In the special case of a model with no explanatory variables, the predicted values are equal to the overall average, so SSR is equal to SST.\nWe calculate SSR for the model using square feet as the explanatory variable.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{SSR} & = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2.  \\\\\n& = (335 - 113.2)^2 + (1450 - 911.5)^2 + (267.5 - 373.1)^2 + \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can calculate the model’s SSR directly in R.\n\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft &lt;- sum(M_House_price_sqft$residuals^2)\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft\n\n[1] 34576162\n\n\nSSR represents the amount of total variability in saleprice remaining after accounting for the house’s size in square feet.\nThe SSR=34576162.0524397 value is about one third of the SST value of 91640003.8131156. This means that about 2/3 of the total variability in sale price is explained by the model that accounts for sale price.\nThe difference (SST-SSR) represents the variability in the response variable that is explained by the model. This quantity is called the model sum of squares (SSM).\n\\[ \\text{SSM} = \\text{SST} - \\text{SSR} \\]\nIt can be shown that \\(\\text{SSM}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i-\\bar{y})^2\\).\nThe proportion of total variability in the response variable explained by the model is called the coefficient of determination, denoted \\(R^2\\). We calculate this by dividing SSM by SST.\n\\[\nR^2=\\frac{SSM}{SST}= \\frac{SST-SSR}{SST}\n\\]\nExample: For the model with square feet as the explanatory variable,\n\\[\nSSM = SST-SSR = 91640004 - 34576162 = 57063842 .\n\\]\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{34576162}{91640004}=0.62.\n\\]\nApproximately 62.3% of the total variability in sale price is explained by the model using square feet as the explanatory variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate \\(R^2\\) directly in R.\n\nsummary(M_House_price_sqft)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.6226958\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Linear Correlation Coefficient\nFor models with a single quantiative explanatory varible, the coefficient of determination is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient \\(r\\), discussed in Chapter 1.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_bw() + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + \n  xlab(\"Square Feet\") + \n  ylab(\"Price (in thousands)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor linear models with a single quantitative variable, the linear correlation coefficient \\(r=\\sqrt{R^2}\\), or \\(r=-\\sqrt{R^2}\\) (with sign matching the sign on the slope of the line), provides information about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables.\n\\(-1 \\leq r \\leq 1\\), and \\(r\\) close to \\(\\pm1\\) provides evidence of strong linear relationship, while \\(r\\) close to 0 suggests linear relationship is weak.\n\n\ncor(Houses$price, Houses$sqft_living)\n\n[1] 0.7891107\n\n\nThere is a positive and fairly strong relationship between price and square feet of a house.\nWhile the correlation coefficient, \\(r\\) is equal to the square root of \\(R^2\\) in the simple case of a model with one quantitative explanatory variable and a quantitative response variable, \\(R^2\\) has much broader application, as \\(r\\) is defined only for models with one quantitative explanatory variable and a quantitative response, while \\(R^2\\) is relevant for any linear model with a quantitative response variable.\n\n\n2.2.5 Variability Explained by Waterfront Model\nWe can similarly calculate the proportion of variability explained by the model using waterfront as an explanatory variable.\nRecall that in this model, the predicted price of a house with a waterfront is given by the average price of all waterfront houses, and the predicted price of a non-waterfront house is given by the average price of all non-waterfront houses.\nWe can calculate residuals using these predicted values, and compare them to the residuals resulting from a model with no explanatory variables, which uses the overall average price for all predictions.\nThe left two figures show the residuals resulting from a model that accounts for waterfront status. The figure on the right shows the residuals resulting from the model with no explanatory variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that after accounting for waterfront status, the differences between observed and predicted values are bigger than they were in the model that accounted for square feet, though not as big as for the model that doesn’t use any explanatory variables.\nWe use R to calculate SSR for the waterfront model.\n\nSSR_M_House_price_wf &lt;- sum(M_House_price_wf$residuals^2)\nSSR_M_House_price_wf\n\n[1] 56895095\n\n\n\\[\nSSM = SST-SSR = 91640004 - 56895095 = 34744909.\n\\]\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{34744909}{91640004}=0.38.\n\\]\nApproximately 37.9145647% of the total variability in sale price is explained by the model using waterfront status as the explanatory variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate \\(R^2\\) directly in R.\n\nsummary(M_House_price_wf)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.3791456\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Variability Explained by Multiple Regression Model\nWe’ve seen at the model using square feet accounts for about 2/3 of the total variability in house prices, while the model using waterfront status accounts for about 1/3 of the total variability. Let’s see if we can do better by using both variables together.\nThe left figure shows the residuals resulting from a model that accounts for both waterfront status and square feet. The figure on the right shows the residuals resulting from the model with no explanatory variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use R to calculate SSR for the waterfront model.\n\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft_wf &lt;- sum(M_House_price_sqft_wf$residuals^2)\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft_wf\n\n[1] 23720774\n\n\n\\[\nSSM = SST-SSR = 91640004 - 23720774 = 67919230.\n\\]\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{67919230}{91640004}=0.74.\n\\]\nApproximately 74.1152631% of the total variability in sale price is explained by the model using square feet and waterfront status as the explanatory variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate \\(R^2\\) directly in R.\n\nsummary(M_House_price_sqft_wf)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.7411526\n\n\nIncluding both square feet and waterfront status allows us to explain more variability in sale price than models that include one but not both of these variables.\n\n\n2.2.7 Adding Age\nWe’ve seen that a multiple regression model that accounts for both square feet and whether or not the house is on the waterfront explains more variability in price than a model with only one of those variables. We can consider adding additional variables to the model to try to even better explain variability with price.\nLet’s consider adding the age of the house to the model.\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft} + b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront} + b_3\\times\\text{Age}\n\\]\nSince we now have two quantitative and one categorical explanatory variable, in addition to our response variable, it is difficult to produce a graph that would visualize this model. We can, however, fit the model in R and calculate predicted values as well as model sums of squares, just as we’ve done before.\nEstimated model coefficients are shown below.\n\nM_House_price_sqft_wf_age &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price ~ sqft_living + waterfront + age)\nM_House_price_sqft_wf_age\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ sqft_living + waterfront + age, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n  (Intercept)    sqft_living  waterfrontYes            age  \n    -353.1583         0.3942       733.2522         1.4212  \n\n\nThe age coefficient estimate \\(b_3\\) tells us that for each additional year in age, the expected price is expected to increase by 1.4 thousand dollars, assuming square feet and waterfront status are held constant. This is not a very large change.\nWe can calculate predicted prices, residuals, SSR, SSM, and \\(R^2\\) the same way we did for the previous models, but let’s rely on R for these calculations.\nSSR:\n\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft_wf_age &lt;- sum((M_House_price_sqft_wf_age$residuals)^2) |&gt;round(1)\nSSR_M_House_price_sqft_wf_age\n\n[1] 23436092\n\n\nSSM:\n\nSSM_M_House_price_sqft_wf_age &lt;- SST_M_House_price - SSR_M_House_price_sqft_wf_age |&gt;round(1)\nSSM_M_House_price_sqft_wf_age\n\n[1] 68203912\n\n\n\\(R^2\\)\n\nsummary(M_House_price_sqft_wf_age)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.7442592\n\n\nRecall that the model with square feet and waterfront, but not age, as explanatory variables had an \\(R^2\\) value of 0.7411526. Adding age to the model only resulted in a tiny increase in \\(R^2\\), meaning that age only explains a very small percentage of the variability in price that was not explained by size and waterfront status. Thus, it may not be beneficial to add age to a model the model.\nWhen a new variable is added SSR will never increase and \\(R^2\\) will never decrease. Thus, adding even unimportant variables typically lead to small decreases in \\(R^2\\). This does not necessarily mean we should add these variables. For one, thing this makes the model harder to interpret. It’s also true that making a model more complex by adding additional variables makes it more prone to a phenomenon called “overfitting.” This means that the model starts modeling random noise, rather than true relationships in the data it was built on (in this case, the 200 houses), causing it to perform worse when predicting new houses than a simpler model with fewer variables would. We’ll look more at overfitting later in the course.\nSometimes, it can be good to include a variable in a model even if it only leads to a small increase in \\(R^2\\). If we were interested in drawing and reporting conclusions on the relationship between the age and expected price of a house, it would be worth including age in the model, so we can report that it does not appear to make much difference. This result might be surprising and interesting in and of itself. There is no single correct model for a given set of data. We should choose models based on relationships we see in the data, as well as the research question(s) we are interested in answering.\n\n\n2.2.8 Summary: SST, SSR, SSM, \\(R^2\\)\n\nthe total variability in the response variable is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the overall average.\n\n\\[\\text{Total Variability in Response Var.}= \\text{SST} =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2\\]\n\nthe variability remaining unexplained even after accounting for explanatory variable(s) in a model is given by the sum of squared residuals. We abbreviate this SSR, for sum of squared residuals.\n\n\\[\n\\text{SSR} = \\text{Variability Remaining}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2\n\\]\n\nthe variability explained by the model, abbreviated SSM, is given by\n\n\\[ \\text{SSM} = \\text{SST} - \\text{SSR} \\]\n\nThe coefficient of determination (abbreviated \\(R^2\\)) is defined as\n\n\\[R^2=\\frac{\\text{Variability Explained by Model}}{\\text{Total Variability}}=\\frac{\\text{SSM}}{\\text{SST}} =\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i-\\bar{y})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}\\]\nNote that some texts use different abbreviations than the ones used here.

We will revisit this later in the course.\n\nExample 1\nLet’s Calculate an ANOVA F-Statistic to compare Models 1 and 3. This will tell us whether adding information about whether or not a house is on the waterfront helps us predict the price, when compared to a model using only square feet of living space.\nReduced Model:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living}\n\\]\nFull Model:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living}+ b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{23720773.8648291 - 34576162.0524397}{2-1}}{\\frac{23720773.8648291}{200-(2+1)}} \\\\  \n& = 90.15\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can calculate the statistic directly in R, using the anova command.\n\nanova(M_House_price_sqft_wf, M_House_price_sqft)$F[2] |&gt;round(2)\n\n[1] 90.15\n\n\nAn F-statistic of 90.15 is quite large and provides strong evidence that adding waterfront status to a model already including square feet helps better explain variability in sale price.\nWe previously saw that the model including both square feet and waterfront status had a \\(R^2\\) value considerably higher than the one including only square feet. This large F-statistic is further evidence of the benefit of using both variables in our model.\nExample 2\nWe’ll calculate an F-statistic to compare Models 3 and 4. This can help us determine whether it is worthwhile to include age in a model that already includes sqaure feet and waterfront status.\nReduced Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living} + b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront}\\]\nFull Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living}+ b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront} + b_3\\times\\text{Age}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{23436092 - 23720773.8648291}{3-2}}{\\frac{23720773.8648291}{200-(3+1)}} \\\\  \n& = 2.38\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can calculate the statistic directly in R, using the anova command.\n\nanova(M_House_price_sqft_wf_age, M_House_price_sqft_wf)$F[2] |&gt;round(2)\n\n[1] 2.38\n\n\nNow, the F-statistic is much smaller than we’ve seen before, indicating that adding age to the model does not help very much in explaining variability in price.\nYou might be wondering how large an F-statistic needs to be in order to merit using the larger model. This is a complicated question, which we’ll explore more in future chapters, but as a general rule, F-statistics larger than 4 typically provide evidence in favor of choosing the larger (full) model over the reduced one.\n\n\n2.3.3 F-Statistic for Comparing Groups\nWhile F-statistics can be used for models with quantitative or categorical variables, they are often used to compare groups for a categorical explanatory variable.\nAn F-statistic compares the amount of variability between groups to the amount of variability within groups. Larger F-statistics indicate more variability between groups, rather than within groups, indicating stronger evidence of differences between groups.\nIn scenario 1, we notice considerable differences between the groups, relative to the amount of variability within groups. In this scenario, knowing the group an observation is in will help us predict the response for that group, so we should include account for the groups in our model. We would obtain a large F-statistic when comparing a model that includes group to one that contains only an intercept term.\nIn scenario 2, there is little difference between the overall averages in each group, and more variability between individual observations within each group. In a scenario like this, knowing the group an observation lies in does little to help us predict the response. In this scenario, predictions from a model that includes group as an explanatory variable would not be much better than those from a model that does not. Hence, we would obtain a small F-statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM_df1_F  &lt;- summary(lm(data=df1, y~Group))$fstatistic[1]\nM_df2_F  &lt;- summary(lm(data=df2, y~Group))$fstatistic[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\n\n\n\n\nvariation between groups\nHigh\nLow\n\n\nvariation within groups\nLow\nHigh\n\n\nF Statistic\nLarge ($F=\\(46.5970149) | Small (\\)F=$M_df2_F)\n\n\n\nResult\nEvidence of Group Differences\nNo evidence of differences\n\n\n\nWe’ll use F-statistics to compare the prices of waterfront houses to non-waterfront houses, and also to compare the three different conditions of houses.\nExample 1: Price by Waterfront Status\nThe boxplot shows the distribution of houses in each category, and the table below it provides a numerical summary.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=waterfront, y=price)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outliers=FALSE) +\n  geom_jitter() + \n  coord_flip() +  \n  stat_summary(fun.y=\"mean\", geom=\"point\", shape=20, color=\"red\", fill=\"red\") + \n  theme_bw() + ggtitle(\"Price by Waterfront Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCond_Tab &lt;- Houses %&gt;% group_by(waterfront) %&gt;% summarize(Mean_Price = mean(price), \n                                             SD_Price= sd (price), \n                                             N= n())\nkable(Cond_Tab)\n\n\n\n\nwaterfront\nMean_Price\nSD_Price\nN\n\n\n\n\nNo\n552.6609\n409.7904\n175\n\n\nYes\n1812.9540\n1073.8480\n25\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen measuring differences between groups for a categorical variable, we compare a model with the categorical variable to one with only an intercept term. In this case, the models are:\nReduced Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0\\]\nFull Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{waterfront}\\]\nWe’ll fit the model in R. The coefficient estimates for \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are shown below.\nWe previously calculated \\(SSR_full\\) to be\n\nSSR_M_House_price_wf |&gt; round(1)\n\n[1] 56895095\n\n\nFor a model containing only an intercept term, like the reduced model, SSR is equal to SST.\n\nSST_M_House_price\n\n[1] 91640004\n\n\nThe F-statistic is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{91640003.8131156 - 56895095.2689966}{1-0}}{\\frac{56895095.2689966}{200-(1+1)}} \\\\  \n& = 120.92\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConfirming the calculation in R, we obtain\n\nanova(M_House_price_wf, M_House_price_0)$F[2]\n\n[1] 120.9154\n\n\nThe F-statistic is very large, indicating strong efidence that waterfront status is associated with the price of a house, which is consistent with what we’ve observed in our plots as well as \\(R^2\\) calculation.\nExample 2: Price by Condition\nOne variable in the houses dataset, which we haven’t looked at yet, is the condition of the house at the time of sale. The table shows the number of houses in either 1) very good, 2) good, or 3) average or below condition.\nThe boxplot shows the distribution of houses in each category, and the table below it provides a numerical summary.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=condition, y=price)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outliers=FALSE) +\n  geom_jitter() + \n  coord_flip() +  \n  stat_summary(fun.y=\"mean\", geom=\"point\", shape=20, color=\"red\", fill=\"red\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCond_Tab &lt;- Houses %&gt;% group_by(condition) %&gt;% summarize(Mean_Price = mean(price), \n                                             SD_Price= sd (price), \n                                             N= n())\nkable(Cond_Tab)\n\n\n\n\ncondition\nMean_Price\nSD_Price\nN\n\n\n\n\naverage or below\n690.1892\n683.0578\n142\n\n\ngood\n729.0987\n671.5967\n47\n\n\nvery_good\n887.7273\n684.5189\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that while houses in very good condition are the most expensive, differences between the three conditions are not that large and there is a lot of variability within each condition group.\nWe’ll calculate an F-statistic for a model that includes condition, compared to a model with only an intercept term.\nReduced Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0\\]\nFull Model: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Price}}= b_0+ b_1 \\times\\text{good condition}+ b_2\\times\\text{very good condition}\\]\nNotice that the equation includes separate variables for the “good” and “very” good conditions. These variables take on value 0 if the house is not in that condition, and 1 if the house is in that condition. Here, the “average or below” condition is considered the “baseline” category.\nWe’ll fit the model in R. The coefficient estimates for \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are shown below.\n\nM_House_price_cond &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~condition)\nM_House_price_cond\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ condition, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n       (Intercept)       conditiongood  conditionvery_good  \n            690.19               38.91              197.54  \n\n\nInterpretations\n\nOn average, houses in average or below condition cost 690.19 thousand dollars.\n\nOn average, houses in good condition cost 38.91 thousand dollars more than those in average or below condition.\n\nOn average, houses in very good condition cost 197.54 thousand dollars more than those in average or below condition.\n\nWe calculate SSR for the full model.\n\nSSR_M_House_price_cond &lt;- sum(M_House_price_cond$residuals^2)\nSSR_M_House_price_cond  \n\n[1] 91219681\n\n\nNote that in this case, \\(p=2\\), since the full model includes terms for both good and very good conditions. For a categorical variable with \\(g\\) groups, there will always be \\(g-1\\) terms in the model equation, one for each category other than the baseline.\nThe F-statistic is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{91640003.8131156 - 91219680.6197368}{2-0}}{\\frac{91219680.6197368}{200-(2+1)}} \\\\  \n& = 0.45\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe perform the calculation directly in R.\n\nanova(M_House_price_cond, M_House_price_0)$F[2]\n\n[1] 0.4538695\n\n\nNotice that the F-statistic of 0.45 is considerably smaller than the F-statistics we’ve seen previously.\nThis indicates that adding condition to a model with no other explanatory variables doesn’t seem to help improve the model’s ability to account for variation in price. Put another way, there doesn’t appear to be much evidence of difference in price between houses in the different conditions. This is again consistent with our conclusion based on the very small change in \\(R^2\\) that we saw when adding condition to the model in the previous section.\n\n\n2.3.4 Relationship Between F-statistic and \\(R^2\\)\nWe’ve seen that both \\(R^2\\) and the F-statistic give us ways of comparing models and determining whether explanatory variables help explain variability in the response.\nYou may be wondering why we need to calculate F-statistics when we already have \\(R^2\\) to answer these questions. Here we’ll look at an example to illustrate the relationship between the two, showing how they’re alike, as well as how they differ.\nShown below are are two different scatterplots displaying relationships between variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nWhich plot do you think displays a stronger relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate \\(R^2\\) values for linear models fit to both sets of data.\n\nM_dfA &lt;- lm(data=dfA, y1~x1)\nsummary(M_dfA)$r.squared \n\n[1] 0.6278261\n\n\n\nM_dfB &lt;- lm(data=dfB, y~x)\nsummary(M_dfB)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.6441707\n\n\nWe see that the \\(R^2\\) values are approximately the same.\nYou might have thought, however, that Scenario B shows a stronger relationship, and this would seem reasonable. Scenario B has 91 observations, while Scenario A only has 4, hence Scenario B has more information justifying a relationship between the variables.\nThe \\(R^2\\) value captures only the strength of the relationship in the observed data, without accounting for the number of observations. In this section, we’ll look at a different statistic that can be used to assess the strength of relationships between variables in a model that, unlike \\(R^2\\), accounts for the sample size.\nFor each a model with explanatory variable \\(x\\) to one with only an intercept term.\nReduced Model: \\[\\widehat{y}= b_0\\]\nFull Model: \\[\\widehat{y}= b_0+ b_1 x\\]\nSince, since \\(p=1\\) and \\(\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}=\\text{SST}\\), the F-statistic becomes:\n\\[\nF= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SST}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{1-0}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(1+1)}}=\n\\frac{\\text{SSM}_{\\text{Full}}}{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}\\times(n-2) =\\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}\\times(n-2)\n\\]\nThus, we see that the F-statistic is closely related to \\(R^2\\), but it’s calculation involves one thing that the \\(R^2\\) calculation does not - the sample size!\nSo, for dataset A in the illustration,\n\\[F= \\frac{0.6278}{`1 - r summary(M_dfA)$r.squared|&gt; round(4)`} \\times (4-2)` = 3.3738318\\],\nwhile for dataset B,\n\\[F= \\frac{0.6442}{`1 - r summary(M_dfB)$r.squared|&gt; round(4)`} \\times (4-2)` = 161.1199341\\].\nWhile the scenarios had similar \\(R^2\\) values, Scenario B had a much greater F-statistic, due to the larger sample, size which provides more evidence of a relationship.\nBoth the F-statistic and \\(R^2\\) are useful measures of a model fit. Neither is necessarily better than the other. The F-statistic accounts for sample size, while \\(R^2\\) simply tells us how strongly related the variables are in the data we have. It is good to consider both when building and assessing models.\n\n\n2.3.5 Comparing 3 or More Categories\nF-statistics are commonly used when making comparisons involving categorical variables with 3 or more categories.\nOne variable in the houses dataset, which we haven’t looked at yet, is the condition of the house at the time of sale. The table shows the number of houses in each condition listed.\n\nsummary(Houses$condition)\n\naverage or below             good        very_good \n             142               47               11 \n\n\nWe notice that there is only one house in poor condition and one house in fair condition. These sample sizes are too small to analyze. We’ll combine these two houses with those in the “average” category, creating a new category called “average or below).\n\n\n2.3.6 Alternate F-Stat Formula\nWe saw that F-statistics are useful for comparing categorical variables with multiple groups. The “variation between” over “variation within” interpretation of an F-statistic lends itself to another (mathematically equivalent) formula for the F-statistic. We calculate the ratio of variability between different groups, relative to the amount of variability within each group\nFor a categorical variable with \\(g\\) groups,\n\nlet \\(\\bar{y}_{1\\cdot}, \\ldots, \\bar{y}_{g\\cdot}\\) represent the mean response for each group.\nlet \\(n_1, \\ldots, n_g\\) represent the sample size for each group\nThen \\(\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^g\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}n_i(y_{i\\cdot}-\\bar{y}_{\\cdot\\cdot})^2}{g-1}\\) gives a measure of how much the group means differ, and\n\\(\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^g\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{i\\cdot})^2}{n-g}\\) gives a measure of how much individual observations differ within groups\nAn alternative formula for this F-statistic is:\n\n\\[\nF= \\frac{\\text{Variability between groups}}{\\text{Variability within groups}}= \\frac{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^g\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}n_i(y_{i\\cdot}-\\bar{y}_{\\cdot\\cdot})^2}{g-1}}{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^g\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{i\\cdot})^2}{n-g}}\n\\]\nIt can be shown that this statistic is equivalent to the one we saw previously.\nFor models with only one categorical explanatory variable, “variability within vs variability between” interpretation of an F-statistic is frequently in the natural and social sciences. Such studies are often referred to as One-Way ANOVA’s. In fact, these are just a special case of the “full vs reduced” model interpretation of the F-statistic, which can be applied to any two models, as long as one is a submodel of the other. In this class, we’ll use the more general “full vs reduced” model formula, but you should be aware that this other formula is just a special case of the one we’ll use in this class.",

    "text": "2.4 Least Squares Estimation (LSE)\n\n2.4.1 Estimating Regression Coefficients\nWe’ve already used R to determine the estimates of \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\) in various kinds of linear models. At this point, it is natural to wonder where these estimates are come from.\nRegression coefficients \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are chosen in a way that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. That is, we minimize\n\\[\n\\text{SSR} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2\n\\]\nBecause \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is a function of \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\), we can choose the values of \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) in a way that minimizes SSR.\n\\[\\text{SSR} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 \\]\nThe process of estimating regression coefficients \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) in a way that minimizes SSR is called least-squares estimation.\nExample: Model with one quantitative variable\nWe start with an example of estimating the regression coefficients for a model with a single explanatory variable. This is easy to illustrate, since we can draw a scatter plot displaying our explanatory and response variable.\nThe figure below illustrates four possible trend lines that could be fit to a set of 10 points in a scatter plot. The first line is the line of best fit, in that it makes the sum of the squared residuals the smallest of all possible lines that could be drawn. The second through fourth plots all show examples of other trend lines that are not the line of best fit. The sum of squared residuals for each of these models is bigger than for the first one.\nIn the illustration, SSR is represented by the total area of the squares. The line of best fit is the one that make the intercept the smallest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Rossman-Chance applet provides an illustration of the line of best fit.\n\nReturning to the model for predicting price of a house, using only size in square feet as an explanatory variable, the scatter plot, along with the slope and intercept of the regression line are shown below.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price)) + geom_point() + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM_House_price_sqft\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ sqft_living, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  sqft_living  \n  -364.8497       0.4641  \n\n\nThe line \\(\\text{Price} = -485 + 0.5328 \\times \\text{Square Feet}\\) is the “line of best fit” in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (SSR). Any other choices for the slope or intercept of the regression line would result in larger SSR than this line.\n\n\n2.4.2 Mathematics of LSE for SLR\n\nConsider a simple linear regression(SLR) model, which is one with a singe quantitative explanatory variable \\(x\\).\n\\(\\hat{y}_i = b_0+b_1x_i\\)\nwe need to choose the values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) that minimize:\n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(b_0+b_1x_i))^2\n\\]\nWe setup the equation by substituting in the values of \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_i\\) seen in the data.\nRecall the first 3 houses in the dataset:\n\nkable(First3Houses)\n\n\n\n\nID\nprice\nwaterfront\nsqft_living\n\n\n\n\n90\n335.0\nNo\n1030\n\n\n126\n1450.0\nNo\n2750\n\n\n300\n267.5\nNo\n1590\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{100}(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 & =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(b_0+b_1x_i))^2 \\\\\n& = (1225-(b_0+b_1(5420)))^2 + (885-(b_0+b_1(2830)))^2 + (385-(b_0+b_1(1620)))^2 + \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe need to find the values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) that minimize this expression. This is a 2-dimensional optimization problem that can be solved using multivariable calculus or numerical or graphical methods.\nUsing calculus, it can be shown that this quantity is minimized when\n\n\\(b_1=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i-\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i }{n}}{\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 -\\frac{\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\right)^2}{n}\\right)}\\)\n\\(b_0=\\bar{y}-b_1\\bar{x}\\) (where \\(\\bar{y}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i}}{n}\\), and \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}}{n}\\)).\n\n\n\n2.4.3 LSE for Categorical Variable\n\nConsider a model with a single categorical variable (such as waterfront), with G+1 categories, numbered \\(g=0,2, \\ldots, G\\)\nThen \\(\\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots +b_{G}x_{iG}\\).\nwe need to minimize\n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots +b_{G}x_{iG}))^2.   \n\\]\n\nIt can be shown that this is achieved when\n\n\\(b_0 = \\bar{y_0}\\) (i.e. the average response in the “baseline group”), and\n\n\\(b_j = \\bar{y_j} - \\bar{y}_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 LSE More Generally\n\nFor multiple regression models, including those involving interaction, the logic is the same. We need to choose \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) in order to minimize\n\n\\[ \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 \\]\n\nThe mathematics, however, are more complicated and require inverting a matrix. This goes beyond the scope of this class, so we will let R do the estimation and use the results.\nMore on least squares estimation in multiple regression can be found here.",

To get the most from the question, it is recommended that you complete the part that is consistent with the amount of mathematics you have taken previously.\nOption A - suggested for students who have taken multivariable calculus (MATH 155)\nUse calculus to show that the quantity in (c) is minimized when \\(b_0 = 79\\), and \\(b_1=1.5\\). Note: this question is not asking you to plug into the formulas for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) in 2.4.2 of the notes. Rather, you are to perform the derivation to show that these values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) minimize the desired quantity in this context.\nOption B - suggested for students who have taken calculus (MATH 140 or equivalent), but not multivariable calculus\nSubstitute \\(b_0 = 79\\) into the expression from part C, so that \\(b_1\\) is the only variable in the expression. Then use calculus to show that this expression is minimized when \\(b_1 = 1.5\\).\nOption C - suggested for students who have not taken calculus\nSubstitute \\(b_0 = 79\\) into the expression from part C, so that \\(b_1\\) is the only variable in the expression. Use an online graphing calculator (such as https://www.desmos.com/calculator) to graph SSR as a function of \\(b_1\\) (hint, make \\(b_1\\) the x-variable). Show that SSR is minimized when \\(b_1=1.5\\). Include a screen shot of your graph.",

Instead, we might collect data on only a subset of the individuals, and then make inferences about all individuals we are interested in, using the information we collected.\nVocabulary:\n\nA population is the entire set of individuals that we want to draw conclusions about.\nA sample is a subset of a population.\n\nA parameter is a numerical quantity pertaining to an entire population or process.\n\nA statistic is a numerical quantity calculated from a sample.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to explore how statistics calculated from a sample compare to the entire population.\nWe’ll work with data from the American National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES). This is a survey administered to civilian residents of the United States, which aims to collect data on several health and socioeconomic factors.\nThe dataset contains information on 12,280 adult U.S. residents. While this is really just a sample of all U.S. residents, let’s pretend for the purposes of this section that this really was our entire population. Perhaps, we can pretend that these are all the adults living in a certain town.\nThe first 6 rows of the data are shown below.\n\nhead(Population)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  Gender   Age Race1   Education HHIncomeMid HomeOwn Height Weight SleepHrsNight\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 male      34 White   High Sch…       30000 Own       165.   87.4             4\n2 female    60 Black   High Sch…       12500 Rent      166   117.              4\n3 male      26 Mexican 9 - 11th…       30000 Rent      173    97.6             4\n4 female    49 White   Some Col…       40000 Rent      168.   86.7             8\n5 male      80 White   Some Col…       17500 Own       174.   79.1             6\n6 male      80 White   9 - 11th…       17500 Own       180.   89.6             9\n\n\nOne of the variables SleepHrsNight is a self-reported estimate of the number of hours of sleep the participant gets at night or on the weekends.\nThe histogram shows the distribution of sleep hours among the 12,280 residents in the population.\n\nSleep_Plot_Pop &lt;- ggplot(data=Population, aes(x=SleepHrsNight)) + \n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue\", boundary=0, binwidth=1, color=\"white\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Hours of Sleep\") + theme_bw()\nSleep_Plot_Pop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the distribution of sleep hours is roughly symmetric, with most people getting between 5 and 8 hours per night.\nWe’ll calculate the mean and standard deviation in hours of sleep among the population.\n\nPopulation |&gt; summarize(Mean_Sleep = mean(SleepHrsNight),\n                        SD_Sleep = sd(SleepHrsNight), \n                        N= n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  Mean_Sleep SD_Sleep     N\n       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1       6.86     1.44 12280\n\n\nRecall that if we fit a statistical model with no explanatory variables, the intercept estimate will be the overall population mean.\nIn this case, we’ll denote the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\), rather than \\(b_0\\), as we’ve done before.

Since \\(b_0\\) shouldn’t be expected to match \\(\\beta_0\\) exactly, we cannot say that \\(\\beta_0\\) is exactly \\(b_0\\), but we can say that \\(\\beta_0\\) is likely to be “close: to \\(b_0\\). In order to know how”close”, we need to know how much the sample statistic \\(b_0\\) could plausibly differ from the population parameter \\(\\beta_0\\).\nTo investigate that, let’s take some additional samples of size 75, fit a model to estimate the mean hours of sleep \\(b_0\\) and see how much \\(b_0\\) varies between samples.\nSecond Sample\n\nSample2 &lt;- sample(Population, size = 75)\nM_Sample2_sleep &lt;- lm(data=Sample2, SleepHrsNight ~ 1)\nM_Sample2_sleep\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SleepHrsNight ~ 1, data = Sample2)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n       6.52  \n\n\nThird Sample\n\nSample3 &lt;- sample(Population, size = 75)\nM_Sample3_sleep &lt;- lm(data=Sample3, SleepHrsNight ~ 1)\nM_Sample3_sleep\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SleepHrsNight ~ 1, data = Sample3)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n      6.627  \n\n\nFourth Sample\n\nSample4 &lt;- sample(Population, size = 75)\nM_Sample4_sleep &lt;- lm(data=Sample4, SleepHrsNight ~ 1)\nM_Sample4_sleep\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SleepHrsNight ~ 1, data = Sample4)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n      6.547  \n\n\nFifth Sample\n\nSample5 &lt;- sample(Population, size = 75)\nM_Sample5_sleep &lt;- lm(data=Sample5, SleepHrsNight ~ 1)\nM_Sample5_sleep\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SleepHrsNight ~ 1, data = Sample5)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n      6.933  \n\n\nLet’s now take 10,000 more random samples of 75 adult residents and record \\(b_0\\), the estimated mean hours of sleep for each sample.\n\nSamples_sleep &lt;- do(10000)*lm(SleepHrsNight ~ 1, data = sample(Population, size=75))\n\nThe histogram below shows the distribution of \\(b_0\\), the mean hours of sleep in the 10,000 different samples.\n\nSamp_Dist_Mean_sleep &lt;- ggplot(data=Samples_sleep, aes(x=Intercept)) +\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\", fill=\"lightblue\", binwidth=0.01) + \n  ggtitle(\"Sampling Distribution for b0 - Mean Hours of Sleep\") + \n  xlab(\"Mean Hours in Sample\") + theme_bw()\nSamp_Dist_Mean_sleep \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that most of our 10,000 samples yielded means between 6.5 and 7.25 hours and that the distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped.\nThe distribution shown in this histogram is called the sampling distribution for \\(b_0\\). The sampling distribution for a statistic shows the distribution of the statistic over many samples.\nWe’ll calculate the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution. How do these compare to the mean and standard deviation of the population that we saw previously?\n\nSamples_sleep |&gt; summarize(Mean_b0 = mean(Intercept),\n                              SE_b0 = sd(Intercept), \n                              N= n())\n\n  Mean_b0     SE_b0     N\n1 6.85564 0.1664173 10000\n\n\nNotice that the mean of the sampling distribution for \\(b_0\\) is about the same as the population mean \\(\\beta_0\\) = 6.86\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution for the mean \\(b_0\\), however, is much less than the population standard deviation of 1.435. This makes sense, since there is much less variability in the sampling distribution for the mean hours of sleep than there was in the distribution of sleep hours for individuals. We saw that most individuals reported getting between 5 and 8 hours per night, while most samples of size 75 resulted in a mean between 6.5 and 7.25 hours, a much narrower range.\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution for a statistic is also called the standard error of the statistic. In this case, it represents the amount of variability in mean hours of sleep between different samples of 75 residents. This is different than the population standard deviation, which represents the amount of variability in hours of sleep between different individual residents.\nVocabulary:\n\nThe sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of values the statistic takes on across many different samples of a given size.\n\nThe standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of that statistic’s sampling distribution. It measures how much the statistic varies between different samples of a given size.\n\n\nEffect of Sample Size\nQuestion:\nSuppose the sample consisted of 10, or 30, or 200 residents, instead of 75? Would you expect the standard deviation of individual sleep times in the samples to increase, decrease or stay about the same? What about the standard error of the mean sleep time?\nThe histogram shows the distribution of sample standard deviations in random samples of each size. These represent the variability in sleep hours between individuals in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the variability in sleep hours between individual people stays roughly the same, regardless of sample size.\nThe table shows the standard deviation of individual sleep hours in each of the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample_Size\nSD\n\n\n\n\n10\n1.567021\n\n\n30\n1.383399\n\n\n75\n1.245966\n\n\n200\n1.419746\n\n\n\n\n\nSample size does not impact the amount of variability between individual people. Standard deviation in sleep hours does not systematically increase or decrease based one sample size (of course it varies a little based on the people randomly chosen in the sample).\nNow, we’ll examine what happens to the standard error of the mean \\(b_0\\) as the sample size changes.\nDistributions of Mean Between Different Samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped, and also more concentrated around the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\nThe table shows the standard error of the mean for samples of different size:\n\n\n\n\n\nSample_Size\nSE\n\n\n\n\n10\n0.4547698\n\n\n30\n0.2624521\n\n\n75\n0.1637800\n\n\n200\n0.0995903\n\n\n\n\n\nAs sample size increases, variability between means of different samples decreases. Standard error of the mean decreases. This is also true of standard errors for other statistics (i.e. difference in means, regression slopes, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Confidence Intervals\nWe saw that while statistics calculated from individual samples deviate from population parameters, over many samples, they approximately average to the population parameter (assuming the samples are chosen randomly).\nThus, when we have only a single sample, we can use the sample statistic as an estimate of the population parameter, provided we allow for a certain margin of error. The question is how much margin of error do we need?\nThe sampling distribution for the mean hours of sleep is shown again below. The population mean (\\(\\beta_0=6.856\\)) is marked by the purple dotted line. The gold bar at the bottom of the histogram represents the range of sample proportions that lie within \\(\\pm 2\\) standard errors of the true population mean:\n6.86 - 2(0.17) = 6.53 to \n6.86 + 2(0.17) = 7.19.\n\nSamp_Dist_Mean_sleep + geom_vline(xintercept=M_Pop_sleep_b0, color=\"purple\", linetype=\"dotted\", linewidth=2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x= M_Pop_sleep_b0 - 2*SE_b0, xend= M_Pop_sleep_b0 + 2*SE_b0, y=20, yend=20), color=\"gold\", size=20, alpha=0.01) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the proportion of samples whose mean hours of sleep lies within \\(\\pm 2\\) standard errors of the true proportion.\n\nLower &lt;- M_Pop_sleep_b0 - 2*SE_b0 \nUpper &lt;- M_Pop_sleep_b0 + 2*SE_b0 \nsum((Samples_sleep$Intercept &gt;=Lower) & (Samples_sleep$Intercept &lt;= Upper))\n\n[1] 9536\n\n\nApproximately 95% of the 10,000 samples produced proportions within \\(\\pm 2\\) standard errors of the true population mean.\nIn a real situation, we won’t have access to the entire population, but only a single sample. For example, recall our original sample of 75 people, in which we observed a proportion of on-time arrivals of \\(b_0=\\) 6.71.\nSince we now know that 95% of all samples produce proportions that lie within two standard errors of the population mean, we can obtain an estimate of the population mean \\(\\beta_0\\) by adding and subtracting \\(2\\times \\text{SE}(b_0)\\) from our observed sample estimate \\(b_0\\).\nUsing probability theory, it can be shown generally that if the sampling distribution of a statistic is symmetric and bell shaped, then approximately 95% of all samples will produce sample statistics that lie within two standard errors of the corresponding population parameter. Such an interval is called an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population parameter.\nApproximate 95% confidence interval: If the sampling distribution of a statistic is symmetric and bell-shaped, a 95% confidence interval for the population parameter is:\n\\[\n\\text{Statistic} \\pm 2\\times \\text{Standard Error},\n\\]\nMore generally, if we want to use a level of confidence that is different than 95%, we can adjust the value we multiply the standard error by. In general, a standard error confidence interval has the form:\n\\[\n\\text{Statistic} \\pm m\\times \\text{Standard Error},\n\\]\nwhere the value of \\(m\\) depends on the desired level of confidence.\nConfidence intervals that are calculated by adding and subtracting a certain number of standard errors from the sample statistic are called standard error confidence intervals. This approach works as long as the sampling distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. Probability theory tells us that in a symmetric and bell-shaped distribution, approximately 95% of the area lies within two standard errors of the center of the distribution, given by the true parameter value. We will, however, see that this approach will not work in all cases. Not all statistics produce sampling distributions that are symmetric and bell-shaped, and we will need an alternative way to calculate confidence intervals in these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/foundations-mathematical\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: 95% Confidence Interval for \\(\\beta_0\\)\nWe’ll calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean hours of sleep in our fictional city, using our original sample where \\(b_0\\) = 6.71. The 95% confidence interval is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0 \\pm 2\\times \\text{SE}(b_0) \\\\\n& = 6.71 \\pm 2(0.17)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe confidence interval is:\n\nc(b0 - 2*SE_b0, b0 + 2*SE_b0) |&gt; as.numeric() |&gt; round(2)\n\n[1] 6.37 7.04\n\n\nBased on our sample of 75 residents, we can be 95% confident that the mean number of hours of sleep among all residents in the city is between 6.37 and 7.04 hours.\nKnowing what we do about the true value of the population parameter \\(\\beta_0\\), we can see that our interval does indeed contain the true population value of \\(\\beta_0=\\) 6.86.\n\n\nWhat does 95% Confidence Mean?\nSuppose, instead of \\(\\beta_0=\\) 6.8560261, our sample of 75 had resulted in a mean of \\(\\beta_0=\\) 6.3. We can see from the sampling distribution that some samples did produce means that low.\nThen, using the same formula we would obtain an approximate 95% confidence interval of\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 6.3 \\pm 2\\times \\text{SE}(b_0) \\\\\n& = 6.3 \\pm 2(0.17)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich is 5.97 to 6.63.\nNotice that this interval does not contain the true value of \\(\\beta_0=6.85\\). Does this mean we did something wrong when we calculated the confidence interval?\nThe answer is “no”. Notice we claimed to be only “95%” confident that our interval contains the true value of the population parameter \\(\\beta_0\\). This means that we should expect 5% of samples taken randomly to yield a sample mean \\(b_0\\) so different from the population mean \\(\\beta_0\\), that the resulting confidence interval would not contain the true value of \\(\\beta_0\\). This does not mean we did anything wrong, just that we obtained an unusual sample just by chance. Since our procedure, namely adding and subtracting two standard errors, is designed to work 95% of the time, we can expect such samples to be rare.\nIn a real situation, we won’t know the true value of the population parameter, so we won’t know for sure whether or not our confidence interval contains this true parameter value.\nTo further understand the meaning of “95% confidence”, let’s explore what happens when we calculate confidence intervals based on estimates \\(b_0\\) obtained from many different samples. For each of our 10,000 different samples taken from our population, we’ll add and subtract two standard errors from the sample mean \\(b_0\\) corresponding to that sample.\nThe table below displays the value of \\(b_0\\), for the first 20 samples we took, along with the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, and whether or not the confidence interval contains the true parameter value \\(\\beta_0\\) (either 1=TRUE or 0=FALSE).\n\nSamples_df_b0 &lt;- Samples_sleep %&gt;% mutate(Sample = row_number(),\n                                                b_0 = Intercept,\n                                                Lower = b_0 - 2*SE_b0, \n                                                Upper = b_0 + 2*SE_b0,\n                                                Contains_beta0 = beta0 &gt;= Lower & beta0 &lt;= Upper) |&gt;\n                                                    dplyr::select(Sample, b_0, Lower, Upper, Contains_beta0)  \nkable(head(Samples_df_b0 |&gt; round(2), 20))\n\n\n\n\nSample\nb_0\nLower\nUpper\nContains_beta0\n\n\n\n\n1\n7.03\n6.69\n7.36\n1\n\n\n2\n6.87\n6.53\n7.20\n1\n\n\n3\n6.88\n6.55\n7.21\n1\n\n\n4\n7.04\n6.71\n7.37\n1\n\n\n5\n7.04\n6.71\n7.37\n1\n\n\n6\n6.84\n6.51\n7.17\n1\n\n\n7\n6.96\n6.63\n7.29\n1\n\n\n8\n7.07\n6.73\n7.40\n1\n\n\n9\n6.80\n6.47\n7.13\n1\n\n\n10\n6.67\n6.33\n7.00\n1\n\n\n11\n6.85\n6.52\n7.19\n1\n\n\n12\n6.64\n6.31\n6.97\n1\n\n\n13\n6.81\n6.48\n7.15\n1\n\n\n14\n6.72\n6.39\n7.05\n1\n\n\n15\n6.60\n6.27\n6.93\n1\n\n\n16\n6.65\n6.32\n6.99\n1\n\n\n17\n6.68\n6.35\n7.01\n1\n\n\n18\n6.55\n6.21\n6.88\n1\n\n\n19\n7.15\n6.81\n7.48\n1\n\n\n20\n6.95\n6.61\n7.28\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphic below visualizes the confidence intervals produced using the estimates from the first 100 samples. The purple dotted line indicates the true value of \\(\\beta_0\\). The black dots indicate the value of \\(b_0\\) for each sample. Intervals that do in fact contain the true value of \\(p\\) are shown in blue, and intervals that do not contain the true value of \\(p\\) are shown in green.\n\nggplot(data=Samples_df_b0[1:100,], aes(y=Sample, x=b_0)) +    \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = Lower, xmax = Upper, color=Contains_beta0))  + \n  xlab(\"Confidence Interval\") + \n  ylab(\"Sample\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = beta0, color=\"purple\", linetype=\"dotted\", size=2) + \n  ggtitle(\"100 Different Confidence Intervals for beta_0\") + \n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of these 100 samples, 91 contain the true value of the population parameter \\(p\\). This is close to the desired 95% confidence level.\nThe picture shows confidence intervals produced by the first 100 samples, but we actually took 10,000 different samples of 75 residents. Let’s calculate how many of these samples produced confidence intervals that contain the true value of \\(p\\).\n\nprop(Samples_df_b0$Contains_beta0 == TRUE)\n\nprop_TRUE \n   0.9536 \n\n\nAgain, notice that close to 95% of the samples produced confidence intervals contain the true population parameter \\(\\beta_0\\). Note that for the red intervals that do not contain \\(p\\) nothing was done incorrectly. The sample was taken at random, and the confidence interval was calculated using the correct formula. It just happened that by chance, we obtained a sample mean \\(b_0\\) that was unusually high or low, leading to an interval that did not capture the true population parameter. This, of course, happens rarely, and approximately 95% of the samples do, in fact, result in intervals that contain the true value of \\(b_0\\).\nThis brings us back to the question “what does 95% confidence mean?”. An approximate 95% confidence interval means that if we take a large number of samples and calculate confidence intervals from each of them, then approximately 95% of the samples will produce intervals containing the true population parameter. In reality, we’ll only have on sample, and won’t know whether or not our interval contains the true parameter value. Assuming we have taken the sample and calculated the interval correctly, we can rest assured in the knowledge that that 95% of all intervals taken would contain the true parameter value, and hope that ours is among that 95%.\nIt might be tempting to say that “there is approximately a 95% chance” that the population parameter lies within the confidence interval, but this is incorrect. In the statistical framework used here (known as classical, or frequentist statistics), the population parameter is assumed to be a fixed, but (typically) unknown number. It either is within the interval, or it isn’t. We just (typically) don’t know which. There’s nothing random about whether or not the parameter value is in our interval, so it doesn’t make sense to speak of it in terms of chance or randomness. Randomness comes into play due to the fact that we selected a random sample, which will produce a statistic likely to differ from the population parameter due to sampling variability. A different statistical framework, known as Bayesian statistics approaches this differently, and would allow us to use randomness and chance to describe our beliefs about any uncertain quantity, including a population proportion. In this class, however, we’ll stick to the classical frequentist interpretation.\nOf course, you might ask why we needed to calculate a confidence interval for the mean hours of sleep among all residents in the first place, since we actually have data on all 12,280 residents in our fictional town and already know the mean hours of sleep. The answer is that we don’t. But, in most real situations, we will only have data from a single sample, not the entire population, and we won’t know the true population parameter. We’ll be able to build on the ideas of sampling distributions and standard error that we learned about in this section to calculate confidence intervals in those scenarios.",

As we saw in the previous section, we should not expect the population proportion to exactly match the sample, due to random variability between samples. We can, however, use the sample statistic as an estimates and construct confidence intervals for the unknown population proportions.\nIn order to construct the confidence interval, we need to know how much each statistic could vary between different samples of size 53. That is, we need to know the standard error. In the previous section, we calculated the standard error by taking 10,000 different samples of the same size as ours from the population, calculating the proportion for each sample, and then calculating the standard deviation of the proportions obtained from these 10,000 different samples. This procedure will not work here, however, because unlike the previous example where we really did have data on the entire population of our city’s residents, we do not have data on all 30,000+ lakes in Florida. We cannot take a lot of different samples of size 53 from the population of all lakes, and thus, cannot obtain the sampling distributions for our statistics or calculate their standard errors. Instead, we’ll use a process that closely mimics what we did in Section 3.1, using only the information from the 53 lakes contained in our sample.\n\n\n3.2.2 Bootstrap Sampling\nAll we have is a single sample of 53 lakes. We need to figure out how much the mean mercury level would vary between different samples of size 53, using only the information contained in our one sample.\nTo do this, we’ll implement a popular simulation-based strategy, known as bootstrapping.\nLet’s assume our sample is representative of all Florida lakes. Then, we’ll duplicate the sample many times to create a large set that will look like the population of all Florida Lakes. We can then draw samples of 53 from that large population, and record the mean mercury level for each sample of 53.\nAn illustration of the bootstrapping procedure is shown below, using a sample of 12 colored dots, instead of the 53 lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, duplicating the sample many times and selecting new samples of size \\(n\\) has the same effect as drawing samples of size \\(n\\) from the original sample, by putting the item drawn back in each time, a procedure called sampling with replacement. Thus, we can skip the step of copying/pasting the sample many times, and instead draw our samples with replacement.\nThis means that in each new sample, some lakes will be drawn multiple times and others not at all. It also ensures that each sample is different, allowing us to estimate variability in the sample mean between the different samples of size 53.\nAn illustration of the concept of bootstrapping, using sampling with replacement is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variability in a statistic (in this case mean mercury concentration) in our newly drawn samples is used to approximate the variability we would see in our statistic between different samples of 53 lakes if we could draw different samples from the population of all Florida Lakes.\nThe point of bootstrapping is to observe how much a statistic varies between bootstrap samples. This can act as an estimate of how much that statistic would vary between different samples of size \\(n\\), drawn from the population.\nThe steps of bootstrap sampling can be summarized in the following algorithm.\nBootstrap Algorithm\nFor an original sample of size \\(n\\):\n\nTake a sample size \\(n\\) by randomly sampling from the original, with replacement. Thus, some observations will show up multiple times, and others not at all. This sample is called a bootstrap sample.\nCalculate the statistic of interest in the bootstrap sample. This statistic could be a single mean, a difference in means, a regression slope, or other statistics like median, standard deviation, or a proportion.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 many (say 10,000) times, keeping track of the statistic of interest that is calculated in each bootstrap sample.\nLook at the distribution of the statistic across bootstrap samples. The variability in this bootstrap distribution can be used to approximate the variability in the sampling distribution for the statistic of interest.\n\n\nBootstrap Samples of Lakes\nBootstrap Sample 1\nThe resample() function samples the specified number rows from a data frame, with replacement.\nThe lakes in the first sample are shown below.

This will tell how how much our statistics can vary between sample. We’ll take 10,000 different bootstrap samples.\nThe do(10000) command tells R to do the command following it (in this case, take the bootstrap sample and calculate the statistic of interest) 10,000 times. We’ll store the results in a vector called Lakes_Bootstrap_Mean.\nWe’ll take 10,000 bootstrap samples, fit a linear model with only an intercept term, \\(b_0\\), and record the value of \\(b_0\\) in each bootstrap sample.\nBootstrap Distribution for Mean\n\nLakes_Bootstrap_Mean &lt;- do(10000) * lm( Mercury ~ 1, data = resample(FloridaLakes, replace=TRUE))\n\nThe means of the first 5 bootstrap samples are:\n\nhead(Lakes_Bootstrap_Mean$Intercept)\n\n[1] 0.6050943 0.4232075 0.4845283 0.6169811 0.5615094 0.5079245\n\n\nThe distribution of means observed in the 10,000 different bootstrap samples is shown below. This distribution is called the bootstrap distribution.\n\nLakes_Bootstrap_Mean_Plot &lt;- ggplot(data=Lakes_Bootstrap_Mean, aes(x=Intercept)) +  \n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\", fill=\"lightblue\", binwidth=0.02) +\n  xlab(\"b0: Mean Mercury in Sample\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Bootstrap Distribution for b0: Mean Mercury\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + theme_bw()\nLakes_Bootstrap_Mean_Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap distribution is meant to approximate the sampling distribution of the statistic of interest (in this case the mean mercury level). Because it is based on the sample, the bootstrap distribution will be centered at the sample statistic (\\(b_0 = 0.527\\) in this case) while the sampling distribution would have been centered at the population parameter (\\(\\beta_0\\)), the mean mercury level among all Florida lakes, which is unknown. The important things, however, is that the variability in the bootstrap distribution gives a good approximation of the amount of variability in the sampling distribution, so we can use the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution (called bootstrap standard error) in our confidence interval calculation.\nBootstrap Standard Error\nWe calculate the standard deviation of this bootstrap distribution, which is an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\). It measures how much the mean mercury level varies between samples of size 53.\n\nSE_mean &lt;- sd(Lakes_Bootstrap_Mean$Intercept)\nSE_mean\n\n[1] 0.045823\n\n\nNotice that the standard error of the mean is much less than the sample standard deviation of 0.341.\nInterpretations of sample standard deviation and standard error of the mean\n\nThe sample standard deviation (0.341) measures the amount of variability in mercury levels between the 53 individual lakes in our sample.\nThe standard error of the mean (0.045823) measures the amount of variability in sample mean mercury levels between different samples of size 53.\n\nThere is more variability between mercury levels in individual lakes than there is between average mercury levels in different samples of size 53.\n95% Confidence Interval:\nWe calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Statistic} \\pm 2\\times\\text{Standard Error}\n\\]\nIn this case, the statistic of interest is the sample mean \\(b_0=0.527\\). The approximate confidence interval is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\bar{x} \\pm 2\\times\\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) \\\\\n& = 0.527 \\pm 2\\times\\text{0.045823}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n       name     lower    upper level method  estimate margin.of.error\n1 Intercept 0.4375052 0.617128  0.95 stderr 0.5271698      0.08981142\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that the average mercury level among all Florida lakes is between 0.44 and 0.62 parts per million.\nThe 95% confidence interval is shown by the gold bar on the graph of the bootstrap distribution below.\n\nLakes_Bootstrap_Mean_Plot + \n  geom_segment(aes(x = CI$lower, xend = CI$upper, y=50, yend=50), \n               color=\"gold\", size=10, alpha=0.01) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that we are not saying that we are 95% confident that an individual lake lie in this range, or that 95% of all individual lakes lie in this range. We are only saying that we are confident that the average mercury level among all lakes lies in this range. A confidence interval is a statement about a population parameter (in this case the average mercury level), rather than about individual lakes in the population. Since there is more variability about individual lakes than overall averages, we’ll need to make a wider interval when talking about the mercury level for an individual lake.\nPercentile Confidence Intervals\nThe confidence interval we obtained by taking \\(\\text{Estimate} \\pm 2\\times\\text{Standard Error}\\) is called a standard error confidence interval. This method is appropriate when the sampling distribution for our statistic (which we approximate using the bootstrap distribution) is symmetric and bell-shaped. An alternate and more general method for obtaining a confidence interval via bootstrapping is called the bootstrap percentile confidence interval. In this approach, we take the middle 95% of the values in the bootstrap distribution.\nThe percentile bootstrap confidence interval is implemented by setting method=percentile.\n\nCI_SE &lt;- confint(Lakes_Bootstrap_Mean, level = 0.95, parm=c(\"Intercept\"), method = \"percentile\")\nCI_SE\n\n       name    lower     upper level     method  estimate\n1 Intercept 0.440566 0.6190566  0.95 percentile 0.5271698\n\n\nNotice that the standard error confidence interval closely matches the percentile interval. This will be true when the bootstrap distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. When the bootstrap distribution is not symmetric and bell-shaped, then the percentile interval will be more reliable than the standard error interval.",

Since lakes will not have pH level 0 in reality, the intercept no longer has a meaningful interpretation.\n- \\(b_1\\) represents the difference in mean mercury level among lakes in Southern and Northern Florida, assuming they have the same pH.\n- \\(b_2\\) represents the expected change in mercury level for each 1-unit increase in pH, assuming location is the same.\nThe scatterplot displays the relationship between mercury level and pH, colored by location, with parallel regression lines fit to the data.\n\nggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=Mercury, x=pH, color=Location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_parallel_slopes(se=FALSE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that mercury tends to decrease as pH increases.\nWe fit the model in R and display the estimates \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), and \\(b_2\\).\n\nM_Lakes_merc_loc_pH &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury ~ Location + pH)\nM_Lakes_merc_loc_pH\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location + pH, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)    LocationS           pH  \n     1.4071       0.2552      -0.1481  \n\n\n\nOn average, lakes with pH level 0 are expected to have a mercury level of 1.4 ppm.

We can use them as estimates of the coefficients we would see if we were able to fit a regression model to all Florida lakes.\nWe’ll use bootstrapping to determine how much these estimates could vary between samples, and to obtain confidence intervals for the quantities of interest.\nBootstrap Sample 1\nWe select a bootstrap sample and plot the relationship between Mercury, pH, and

\\(b_1\\), and \\(b_2\\), we can also calculate a confidence interval for the average mercury level among all lakes with a given location and pH.\nWe’ll calculate a confidence interval for the average mercury level among all lakes in Southern Florida with a neutral pH level of 7.\nThe regression model equation is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\text{Mercury}} & = b_0 +

sample statistic like all the others we’ve seen. It was calculated from just our sample of 53 lakes, and if we had a different sample, we would have gotten a different estimate. Thus, we need to provide a confidence interval for mean mercury level among all lakes in South Florida with pH 7. We can do that using bootstrapping.\nBootstrap Sample 1\nWe select a bootstrap sample and plot the relationship between Mercury, pH, and location.\n\n#First Bootstrap Sample \nBootstrap1 &lt;- resample(FloridaLakes, replace = TRUE)\n\n#Fit regression model to bootstrap sample\nM_Lakes_merc_loc_pH_Boot1 &lt;- lm(Mercury ~ Location + pH, data=Bootstrap1)\n\n# predict mercury level\npredict(M_Lakes_merc_loc_pH_Boot1, newdata=data.frame(Location = \"S\", pH=7))\n\n        1 \n0.6315449 \n\n\nBased on this bootstrap sample, the mean mercury level among lakes in Southern Florida is estimated to be 0.625398 ppm.\nBootstrap Sample 2\nWe select a bootstrap sample and plot the relationship between Mercury, pH, and location.\n\nBootstrap2 &lt;- resample(FloridaLakes, replace = TRUE)\n\n#Fit regression model to bootstrap sample\nM_Lakes_merc_loc_pH_Boot2 &lt;- lm(Mercury ~ Location + pH, data=Bootstrap2)\n\n# predict mercury level\npredict(M_Lakes_merc_loc_pH_Boot2, newdata=data.frame(Location = \"S\", pH=7))\n\n        1 \n0.5106231 \n\n\nBased on the second bootstrap sample, the mean mercury level among lakes in Southern Florida is estimated to be 0.5106231 ppm.\nWe’ll now take 10,000 different bootstrap samples and look at the bootstrap distribution for \\(b_0 + b_1 + 7b_2\\), the estimated average mercury level among all lakes in Southern Florida with pH = 7.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap &lt;- do(10000) * predict(lm(Mercury ~ Location + pH, data = resample(FloridaLakes)), newdata=data.frame(Location=\"S\", pH=7))\n\nThe bootstrap distribution for average mercury level among all lakes in Southern Florida with pH = 7 is shown below.\n\n# plot for b0 + b_1 + 7*b_2\nM_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap_Plot &lt;- ggplot(data=M_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap, aes(x=X1)) +  \n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\", fill=\"lightblue\", binwidth=0.01) +\n  xlab(\"Estimated Mercury\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Bootstrap Estimate b0 + b1 + 7*b2\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + theme_bw()\n\nM_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap_Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, notice that the bootstrap distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, so we can calculate a confidence interval using the standard error method.\nThe standard error for \\(b_0 + b_1 + 7b_2\\) is\n\nSE_Est &lt;- sd(M_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap$X1)\nSE_Est\n\n[1] 0.05969632\n\n\nThis tells us how much the estimated mercury level among lakes in Southern Florida with pH=7 would vary between different samples of 53 lakes. Note, this is not the same things as the variability between individual lakes with pH 7.\nA 95% confidence interval for mean mercury level among lakes in Southern Florida with pH=7 is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0 + b_1 + 7b_2 \\pm 2\\times\\text{SE}(b_0 + b_1 + 7b_2) \\\\\n& = 0.625 \\pm 2\\times{0.059}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can also calculate the confidence interval using the confint() command below.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap_CI &lt;- do(10000) * predict(lm(Mercury ~ Location + pH, data = resample(FloridaLakes)), newdata=data.frame(Location=\"S\", pH=7), interval = \"confidence\", level=0.95)\n\nCI &lt;- confint(M_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap_CI, parm = \"fit\", method = \"stderr\")\nCI\n\n  name     lower     upper level method estimate margin.of.error\n1  fit 0.5118066 0.7411329  0.95 stderr 0.625398       0.1146632\n\n\n\nM_Lakes_merc_locS_pH7_Bootstrap_Plot  + \n                geom_segment(aes(x=CI$lower, xend=CI$upper , y=50, yend=50), \n                color=\"gold\", size=10, alpha=0.01) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that the mean mercury level among lakes in Southern Florida with pH=7 is between 0.51 and 0.74 ppm.\nIt is important to note that we are not saying that we are 95% confident that the mercury level of an individual lake in South Florida with a pH of 7 will lie in this range. Confidence intervals are about population parameters like averages, rather than about individuals. An interval pertaining to mercury levels in individual lakes would need to be wider than this one. We’ll talk about how to obtain these kinds of intervals later in the course.\n\n\n3.3.4 Bootstrapping Cautions\nWhile bootstrapping is a popular and robust procedure for calculating confidence intervals, it does have cautions and limitations. We should be sure to use the bootstrap procedure appropriate for our context. A standard-error bootstrap interval is appropriate when the sampling distribution for our statistic is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped. When this is not true, a percentile bootstrap interval can be used as long as there are no gaps or breaks in the bootstrap distribution. In situations where there are gaps and breaks in the bootstrap distribution, then the bootstrap distribution may not be a reasonable approximation of the sampling distribution we are interested in.",

(We’ve already seen that for categorical variables, the least-squares estimate is the mean, so this makes sense.)\nWe can use \\(b_1\\) to assess the size of the difference in mean mercury concentration levels.\n\n\nHypotheses and Key Question\nSince the lakes we observed are only a sample of 53 lakes out of more than 30,000, we cannot assume the difference in mercury concentration for all Northern vs Southern Florida lakes is exactly 0.272. Instead, we need to determine whether a difference of this size in our sample is large enough to provide evidence of a difference in average mercury level between all Northern and Southern lakes in Florida.\nOne possible explanation for us getting the results we did in our sample is that there really is no difference in average mercury levels between all lakes in Northern and Southern Florida, and we just happened, by chance, to select more lakes with higher mercury concentrations in Southern Florida than in Northern Florida. A different possible explanation is that there really is a difference in average mercury level between lakes in Northern and Southern Florida.\nIn a statistical investigation, the null hypothesis is the one that says there is no difference between groups , or no relationship between variables in the larger population, and that any difference/relationship observed in our sample occurred merely by chance. The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis, stating that there is a difference/relationship.\nStated formally, the hypotheses are:\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average mercury level between all lakes in Northern Florida and all lakes in Southern Florida.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average mercury level between all lakes in Northern Florida and all lakes in Southern Florida.\nA statistician’s job is to determine whether the data provide strong enough evidence to rule out the null hypothesis.\nThe question we need to investigate is:\n*“How likely is it that we would have observed a difference in means (i.e. a value of* \\(b_1\\)) as extreme as 0.6965-0.4245 = 0.272 ppm, merely by chance, if there is really no relationship between location and mercury level?”\n\n\nPermutation Test Procedure\nWe can answer the key question using a procedure known as a permutation test. In a permutation test, we randomly permute (or shuffle) the values of our explanatory variable to simulate a situation where there is no relationship between our explanatory and response variable. We observe whether it is plausible to observe values of a statistic (in this case the difference in means) as extreme or more extreme than what we saw in the actual data.\nWe’ll simulate situations where there is no relationship between location and mercury level, and see how often we observe a difference in means (\\(b_1\\)) as extreme as 0.272.\nProcedure:\n\nRandomly shuffle the locations of the lakes, so that any relationship between location and mercury level is due only to chance.\nCalculate the difference in mean mercury levels (i.e. value of \\(b_1\\)) in “Northern” and “Southern” lakes, using the shuffled data. The statistic used to measure the size of the difference or relationship in the sample is called the test statistic.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 many (say 10,000) times, recording the test statistic (difference in means, \\(b_1\\)) each time.\nAnalyze the distribution of the test statistic (mean difference), simulated under the assumption that there is no relationship between location and mercury level.

Based on the simulation, it is rare to obtain a difference as extreme as the 0.272 value we saw in the actual data, by chance when there is actually no difference in average mercury levels between Northern and Southern Florida lakes.\nWe calculate the precise number of simulations (out of 10,000) resulting in difference in means more extreme than 0.272.\n\nsum(~ (abs(LocationS) &gt; 0.272), data = Lakes_merc_loc_perm_test)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nThe proportion of simulations resulting in difference in means more extreme than 0.272 is\n\nprop(~ (abs(LocationS) &gt; 0.272), data = Lakes_merc_loc_perm_test)\n\nprop_TRUE \n    0.003 \n\n\nWe only observed a difference between the groups as extreme or more extreme than the 0.272 difference we saw in the sample in a proportion of 30 of our simulations (less than 1%).\nThe probability of getting a difference in means as extreme or more extreme than 0.272 ppm by chance, when there is no relationship between location and mercury level is about 0.003.\nIt is very unlikely that we would have observed a result like we did by chance alone. Thus, we have strong evidence that there is a difference in average mercury level between lakes in Northern and Southern Florida. In this case, there is strong evidence that mercury level is higher in Southern Florida lakes than Northern Florida lakes.\nRecall that in the previous section, we found that we could be 95% confident that the mean mercury level among all lakes in Southern Florida is between 0.08 and 0.46 higher than the mean mercury level among all lakes in Northern Florida.\n\n\nTest-statistic and p-value\nThe statistic we use to measure the size of the difference or effect is called the test statistic. In this case, the test statistic is the difference in means.\nThe p-value represents the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than we did in our sample when the null hypothesis is true.\nIn this situation, the p-value represents the probability of observing a difference in sample means as extreme or more extreme than 0.272 if there is actually no difference in average mercury level among all lakes in Northern Florida, compared to Southern Florida.\nIn our study, the p-value was 0.003, which is very low. This provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no difference in average mercury levels between all Northern and Southern Florida lakes.\nA low p-value tells us that the difference in average Mercury levels that we saw in our sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance, providing evidence that there is indeed a difference in average Mercury levels between Northern and Southern lakes. When a p-value is small enough to suggest that the result was unlikely to have occurred by chance, the result is said to be statistically discernible.\nNote that it is fairly common for people to use the phrase statistically significant instead of statistically discernible. We will avoid this phrase because the word significant can be easily confused with important. Not all statistically discernible results are actually important in a practical sense. The p-value does not tell us anything about the size of the difference! Sometimes, we might get a small p-value even when difference is so small that it is not practically meaningful. This is especially true when we have a large sample size. In addition to a p-value, we should consider whether a difference is big enough to be meaningful in a practical way, before making any policy decisions.\nFor now, we can use the difference in sample means of 0.272 ppm as an estimate of the size of the difference. Based on our limited knowledge of mercury levels, this does seem big enough to merit further investigation, and possible action.\nAt this point, a reasonable question is “how small must a p-value be in order to provide evidence against the null hypothesis?” While it is sometimes common to establish strict cutoffs for what counts as a small p-value (such as \\(&lt;0.05\\)), the American Statistical Association does not recommend this. In reality, a p-value of 0.04 is practically no different than a p-value of 0.06. Rather than using strict cutoffs for what counts as small, it is better to interpreting p-values on a sliding scale, as illustrated in the diagram below. A p-value of 0.10 or less provides at least some evidence against a null hypothesis, and the smaller the p-value is, the stronger the evidence gets.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"pvals.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Chlorophyll in Lakes: N vs S\nChlorophyll, which comes from plants, is also present in water. Unlike mercury, higher levels of chlorophyll are not dangerous, but the amount of chlorophyll can be an indicator of plant life in the lake.

We’ll use a permutation test to investigate whether such a difference could occur by random selection of lakes if there is really no relationship between chlorophyll and location.\nThe hypotheses are:\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average chlorophyll amount between all lakes in Northern Florida and all lakes in Southern Florida.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average chlorophyll amount between all lakes in Northern Florida and all lakes in Southern Florida.\nThe model equation is\n\\(\\widehat{\\text{Chlorophyll}} = b_0 +b_1\\times\\text{South}\\)\n\n\\(b_0\\) represents the mean chlorophyll amount for lakes in North Florida, and\n\n\\(b_1\\) represents the mean difference in chlorophyll amount for lakes in South Florida, compared to North Florida\n\nFitting the model in R, we obtain the estimates for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\).\n\nM_Lakes_chlor_loc &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Chlorophyll ~ Location)\nM_Lakes_chlor_loc\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Chlorophyll ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)    LocationS  \n     24.597       -3.922  \n\n\n\\(b_1\\) gives the mean difference in chlorophyll between the Northern and Southern lakes in our sample.

The difference of -3.9 mg/\\(m^3\\) seen in our sample happens quite often, even in a situation where there is really no relationship between location and chlorophyll amount.\nOur p-value, represemtomg the proportion of simulations resulting in difference in means more extreme than 3.9 is\n\nprop(~ (abs(LocationS) &gt; 3.9), data = Lakes_chlor_loc_perm_test)\n\nprop_TRUE \n   0.6711 \n\n\nThis p-value represents the probability of observing a difference in means as extreme or more extreme than -3.9 \\(mg/m^3\\) if there is really no relationship between location and chlorophyll amount.\nSince the p-value is quite large (much bigger than common criteria like 0.05 or 0.10), we cannot rule out the null hypothesis. It would not be unusual to see data like we did in a situation where the null hypothesis is actually true. Thus, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that average chlorophyll amount differs between lakes in Northern and Southern Florida.\nJust because we cannot rule out, or reject, the null hypothesis does not mean that we should believe it is true. Afterall, we did observe an average difference of about 4 \\(mg/m^3\\). It’s just that given the size of our sample and the amount of variability in the data, we cannot be sure that this difference didn’t occur by chance associated with random selection of the lakes. Thus, while we do not reject the null hypothesis, we also shouldn’t accept it, or believe it to be true. We shouldn’t say that we believe that chlorophyll amount is the same in Northern and Southern Florida, only that we don’t have enough evidence to conclude that it differs. “Accepting” the null hypothesis is a common fallacy committed in hypothesis testing that has sometimes had disastrous implications in scientific research.\n\n\n3.4.3 Effect of pH on Mercury\nNext, we’ll investigate whether there is a relationship between a lake’s mercury level and it’s pH, a measure of the acidity of a lake. A pH of 7 is considered neutral, while a lower pH indicates that the water is more acidic and higher pH indicates that the water is more basic.\nThe plot below shows the relationship between a lake’s mercury level and pH.\n\nggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=Mercury, x=pH)) + \n  geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + \n  xlim(c(3, 10)) + ylim(c(0,1.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a strong relationship between the two, but we should investigate whether such relationship could plausible occur in a sample of 53 lakes, in a situation where there is really no such relationship among all lakes.\nThe regression equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Mercury}} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{pH}\n\\]\nRegression estimates \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are shown below.\n\nLakes_M_merc_pH &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~pH)\nLakes_M_merc_pH\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ pH, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)           pH  \n     1.5309      -0.1523  \n\n\nFor quantitative explanatory variables, we can use the slope of the regression line \\(b_1\\) to measure the strength relationship between Mercury and pH. Based on our sample, for each one-unit increase in pH, mercury level is expected to decrease by 0.15 ppm.\nIf there was really no relationship, then the slope among all lakes would be 0. But, of course, we would not expect the slope in our sample to exactly match the slope for all lakes. Our question of interest is whether it is plausible that we could have randomly selected a sample resulting in a slope as extreme as 0.15 by chance, when there is actually no relationship between mercury and pH levels, among all lakes. In other words, could we plausible have drawn the sample of 53 lakes shown in blue from a population like the one in red, shown below?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Question:\n\nHow likely is it that we would have observed a slope (i.e. a value of \\(b_1\\)) as extreme as 0.15 by chance, if there is really no relationship between mercury level and pH?\n\nNull Hypothesis: Among all Florida lakes, there is no relationship between mercury level and pH.\nAlternative Hypothesis: Among all Florida lakes, there is a relationship between mercury level and pH.\nProcedure:\n\nRandomly shuffle the pH values, so that any relationship between acceleration mercury and pH is due only to chance.\nFit a regression line to the shuffled data and record the slope of the regression line.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 many (say 10,000) times, recording the slope (i.e. value of \\(b_1\\)) each time.\nAnalyze the distribution of slopes, simulated under the assumption that there is no relationship between mercury and pH. Look whether the actual slope we observed is consistent with the simulation results.\n\nWe’ll illustrate the first three permutations.\nFirst Permutation\nRecall these groups were randomly assigned, so the only differences in averages are due to random chance.\n\nLakes_shuffle_pH1 &lt;- FloridaLakes |&gt; mutate(ShuffledpH = shuffle(pH))  \nhead(Lakes_shuffle_pH1)                                 \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n     ID Lake            pH Mercury Chlorophyll Location Depth   ShuffledpH\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Alligator      6.1    1.23         0.7 S        Medium         7.8\n2     2 Annie          5.1    1.33         3.2 S        Deep           6.2\n3     3 Apopka         9.1    0.04       128.

In fact, this never happened in any of our 10,000 simulations!\nThere is very strong evidence of a relationship mercury level and pH.\nA low p-value tells us only that there is evidence of a relationship, not that it is practically meaningful. We have seen that for each one-unit increase in pH, mercury level is expected to decrease by 0.15 ppm on average, which seems like a pretty meaningful decrease, especially considering that mercury levels typically stay between 0 and 1.\nWe used the slope as our test statistic to measure the evidence of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. In fact, we could have also used the correlation coefficient \\(r\\) as our test statistic, and we would have gotten the same p-value. Either slope or correlation may be used for a hypothesis test involving two quantitative variables, but we will use slope in this class.\n\n\n3.4.4 F-Test for Comparing Three or More Groups\nNext, we’ll investigate whether mercury levels tend to differ between lakes of different depths. The Depth variable classifies lakes as either shallow (less than 15 feet at deepest point), medium (15-30 feet deep), or deep (deeper than 30 feet).\nComparative boxplots and a table are shown below.\n\nggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(x=Depth, y=Mercury, fill=Depth)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5) +\n  stat_summary(fun.y=\"mean\", geom=\"point\", shape=20, color=\"red\", fill=\"red\")+ \n  coord_flip() + ggtitle(\"Mercury by Depth\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakes_merc_cond_Tab &lt;- FloridaLakes %&gt;% group_by(Depth) %&gt;% summarize(Mean_Hg = mean(Mercury) |&gt; round(3), \n                                                                SD_Hg= sd (Mercury) |&gt; round(3), \n                                                                N= n())\nkable(Lakes_merc_cond_Tab)\n\n\n\n\nDepth\nMean_Hg\nSD_Hg\nN\n\n\n\n\nDeep\n0.604\n0.307\n15\n\n\nMedium\n0.591\n0.429\n16\n\n\nShallow\n0.428\n0.276\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that mean mercury level is highest in the deepest lakes, and lowest in the shallowest lakes. We’ll again want to investigate whether the differences we see could be evidence of a relationship between depth and mercury level, or whether differences like these could have plausibly occurred even if there was no relationship.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average mercury levels between shallow, medium, and deep lakes.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is no difference in average mercury levels between shallow, medium, and deep lakes.\nIf we were only comparing two groups, we could use the difference in means as a test statistic, like we did when testing for differences in location. But with three groups, we would have three different differences in means to test (shallow-medium, shallow-deep, medium-deep). We need a single statistic that can measure the size of differences between all three groups. An F-statistic can do this, so we’ll use the F-statistic as our test statistic here.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_depth_test &lt;-  do(1) * lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury ~ Depth)\nM_Lakes_merc_depth_test$F\n\n[1] 1.628254\n\n\nOur question of interest is “How likely is it to observe an F-statistic as extreme or more extreme than 1.63 if there is actually no difference in average mercury level between the three depths?”\nWe’ll use a permutation-based hypothesis test to investigate this question.\nProcedure:\n\nRandomly shuffle the depth categories of the lakes, so that any relationship between depth and mercury is due only to chance.\nUsing the shuffled data, calculate an F-statistic for a model predicting mercury, comparing a full model that uses depth as an explanatory variable, to a reduced model with no explanatory variables.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 many (say 10,000) times, recording the F-statistic each time.\nAnalyze the distribution of F-statistics, simulated under the assumption that there is no relationship between depth and mercury level.

The first 6 simulated F-statistics are shown below. Recall that these are simulated under the assumption that there is no difference in average mercury between shallow, medium, and deep lakes, i.e. no relationship between mercury level and depth.\n\nLakes_merc_depth_perm_test &lt;- do(10000) * lm(Mercury ~ shuffle(Depth) , data = FloridaLakes)\nhead(Lakes_merc_depth_perm_test$F)\n\n[1] 0.265481460 0.242068358 0.007345152 1.450498889 1.238486261 0.093325750\n\n\nThe distribution of the F-statistics is shown below. As usual, the red line represents the F-statistic observed in our actual data. Since F-statistics cannot be negative, we don’t need to worry about finding an F-statistic as extreme in the opposite direction.\n\nFstat &lt;- 1.628\nExtreme &lt;- Lakes_merc_depth_perm_test$F &gt; 1.628\n  \n  \nLakes_merc_depth_perm_test_plot &lt;- ggplot(data=Lakes_merc_depth_perm_test, aes(x=F)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Extreme), color=\"white\") + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"blue\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=c(Fstat), color=\"red\") + \n  xlab(\"Lakes Depth: Simulated F-statistic\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of F-stat under assumption of no relationship\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\nLakes_merc_depth_perm_test_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that unlike the permutation distributions we’ve seen before, the distribution of the F-statistic is not symmetric. Recall that F-statistics can only take on positive values, which results in this right-skewed shape. Nevertheless, we can still look at where the F-statistic we observed in our data lies relative to those obtained in a simulation that assumed the null hypothesis of no relationship was true.\nThe result we observed seems pretty consistent with the simulated values in the histogram. The red line is not very extreme.\np-value: Proportion of simulations resulting in F-statistic more extreme than 1.628:\n\nprop(~ (F &gt; 1.628), data = Lakes_merc_depth_perm_test)\n\nprop_TRUE \n   0.2089 \n\n\nThis p-value represents the probabilty of observing an F-statistic as extreme or more extreme than we 1.628 if there is really no relationship between a lake’s depth and mercury level.\nSince the p-value is large, it is plausible that we would see differences like we did in the actual data in a situation where the null hypothesis is true.\nWe cannot reject the null hypothesis. We do not have enough evidence to say that average mercury levels differ between shallow, medium, and deep lakes.\nWe are not saying that we think mercury levels are the same between the three different depths (i.e. we’re not accepting the null hypothesis), just that we don’t have enough evidence to say that they differ.\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Responsible Hypothesis Testing\nWhile hypothesis tests are a powerful tool in statistics, they are also one that has been widely misused, to the detriment of scientific research. The hard caused by these misuses caused the American Statistical Association to release a 2016 statement, intended to provide guidance and clarification to scientists who use hypothesis testing and p-values in their research.\nThe statement provides the following six principles for responsible use of hypothesis tests and p-values.\n\nP-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.\nP-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.\nScientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.\nProper inference requires full reporting and transparency.\nA p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.\nBy itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.\n\nThe statement provides important guidance for us to consider as we work with hypothesis testing in this class, as well as in future classes and potentially in our own research.\n\nA hypothesis test can only tell us the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. The absence of evidence against the null hypothesis should not be interpreted as evidence for the null hypothesis.\nWe should never say that the data support/prove/confirm the null hypothesis.\nWe can only say that the data do not provide evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nWhat to conclude from p-values and what not to:\n\nA low p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis. It suggests the test statistic we observed is inconsistent with the null hypothesis.\nA low p-value does not tell us that the difference or relationship we observed is meaningful in a practical sense. Researchers should look at the size of the difference or strength of the relationship in the sample before deciding whether it merits being acted upon.\nA high p-value means that the data could have plausibly been obtained when the null hypothesis is true. The test statistic we observed is consistent with what we would have expected to see when the null hypothesis is true, and thus we cannot rule out the null hypothesis.\nA high p-value does not mean that the null hypothesis is true or probably true. A p-value can only tell us the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, and should never be interpreted as support for the null hypothesis.\n\nJust because our result is consistent with the null hypothesis does not mean that we should believe that null hypothesis is true. Lack of evidence against a claim does not necessarily mean that the claim is true.\nIn this scenario, we got a small p-value, but we should also be aware of what we should conclude if the p-value is large. Remember that the p-value only measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A large p-value means we lack evidence against the null hypothesis. This does not mean, however, that we have evidence supporting null hypothesis.\nA hypothesis test can be thought of as being analogous to a courtroom trial, where the null hypothesis is that the defendant did not commit the crime. Suppose that after each side presents evidence, the jury remains unsure whether the defendant committed the crime. Since the jury does not have enough evidence to be sure, they must, under the law of the United States find the defendant “not guilty.” This does not mean that the jury thinks the defendant is innocent, only that they do not have enough evidence to be sure they are guilty. Similarly in a hypothesis test, a large p-value indicates a lack of evidence against the null hypothesis, rather than evidence supporting it. As such, we should avoid statements suggesting we “support”, “accept”, or “believe” the null hypothesis, and simply state that we lack evidence against it.\nThings to say when the p-value is small:\n\nThe data are not consistent with the null hypothesis.\n\nWe have evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nWe detect a difference or effect.\n\nThe difference or effect is statistically discernible.\n\nThings NOT to say based on a small p-value alone:\n\nThe difference is practically meaningful or significant.\n\nWe should take action based on the result.\n\nIn some cases, a small p-value might merit taking action, but it is important to also consider the size of the difference, the method of in which the data were collected, and how representative it is, as well as the costs and benefits of a potential decision, rather than acting on a p-value alone.\nThings to say when the p-value is large:\n\nThe data are consistent with the null hypothesis.\n\nWe do not have enough evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nWe cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis is plausible.\n\nThings NOT to say when the p-value is large:\n\nThe data support the null hypothesis.\n\nThe data provide evidence for the null hypothesis.\n\nWe accept the null hypothesis.\n\nWe conclude that the null hypothesis is true.",

    "section": "4.1 The Normal Error Regression Model",
    "text": "4.1 The Normal Error Regression Model\nYou’ve probably noticed that most of the sampling distributions of statistics we’ve seen were symmetric and bell-shaped in nature. When working with statistics that have symmetric and bell-shaped distributions and know standard error formulas, it is possible to use well-known probability facts to obtain confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests without actually performing simulation.\nIn this chapter, we’ll examine a set of assumptions that, if true, would ensure that statistics like means and differences in means, and regression coefficients follow symmetric and bell-shaped distributions. We’ll learn how to use facts from probability to calculate confidence intervals and p-values without actually performing simulation in these instances.\n\n4.1.1 Example: Ice Cream dispenser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose an ice cream machine is manufactured to dispense 2 oz. of ice cream per second, on average. If 15 people used the ice cream machine, holding the dispenser for different amounts of time, and each person got exactly 2 oz. per second, the relationship between time holding the dispenser and amount dispensed would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, however, the actual amount dispensed each time it is used will vary due to unknown factors like:\n\nforce applied to dispenser\n\ntemperature\n\nbuild-up of ice cream\n\nother unknown factors\n\nThus, if 15 real people held the dispenser and recorded the amount of ice cream they got, the scatter plot we would see would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the amount of ice cream a person receives as being a result of two separate components, often referred to as signal and noise.\nSignal represents the average amount of ice cream a person is expected to receive based on the amount of time holding the dispenser. In this case, signal is given by the function \\(\\text{Expected Amount} = 2\\times\\text{Time}\\). Everyone who holds the dispenser for \\(t\\) seconds is expected to receive \\(2t\\) ounces of ice cream.\nNoise represents how much each person’s actual amount of ice cream deviates from their expected amount. For example, a person who holds the dispenser for 1.5 seconds and receives 3.58 oz. of ice cream will have received 0.58 ounces more than expected due to noise (i.e. factors beyond time holding the dispenser).\nIn a statistical model, we assume that the response value of a response variable we observe is the sum of the signal, or expected response, which is a function of the explanatory variables in the model, and noise, which results from deviations due to factors beyond those accounted for in the model.\n\n\n4.1.2 Normal Distribution\nIt is common to model noise using a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution, known as a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the error term as a random draw from somewhere in the area below the bell-curve. For example, in the above illustration, most of the area under the curve lies between \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). If this curve represented the noise term in the ice cream example, it would mean that most people’s actual amount of ice cream dispensed would be within \\(\\pm 1\\) ounce of their expected amount (or signal). Notice that the normal distribution is centered at 0, indicating that on average, a person would be expected to get an amount exactly equal to their signal, but that they might deviate above or below this amount by unexplained factors, which can be modeled by random chance.\nA normal distribution is defined by two parameters:\n- \\(\\mu\\) representing the center of the distribution\n- \\(\\sigma\\) representing the standard deviation\nThis distribution is denoted \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the standard deviation is small, such as for the blue curve, noise tends to be close to 0, meaning the observed values will be close to their expectation. On the other hand, the green curve, which has higher standard deviation, would often produce noise values as extreme as \\(\\pm 2\\) or more.\nNote that the square of the standard deviation \\(\\sigma^2\\) is called the variance. Some books denote the normal distribution as \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), instead of \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)\\). We will use the \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) here, which is consistent with R.\n\n\n4.1.3 Modeling Ice Cream Dispenser\nIn this example, we’ll simulate the amount of ice cream dispensed for each person by adding a random number from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5 to the expected amount dispensed, which is given by \\(2x\\), where \\(x\\) represents time pressing the dispenser. We’ll let \\(\\epsilon_i\\) represent the random noise term for the \\(i\\)th person.\nThus, amount dispensed (\\(Y_i\\)) for person \\(i\\) is given by\n\\[\nY_i = 2x_i+\\epsilon_i, \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.5)\n\\]\nIllustration\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount dispensed follows a normal distribution with mean equal to twice the time holding the dispensor and standard deviation 0.5\n\n\n\n\nWe simulate the amount dispensed for a sample of 15 people below. The rnorm(n, \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) function generates \\(n\\) random numbers from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).

We can generalize this to situations with multiple explanatory variables, which might be numeric or categorical.\nIndividual observations are then assumed to vary from their expectation in accordance with a normal distribution, representing random noise (or error).\nThe mathematical form of a normal error linear regression model is\n\\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1}+ \\ldots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\epsilon_i\\), with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nNote that in place of \\(X_{ip}\\), we could have indicators for categories, or functions of \\(X_{ip}\\), such as \\(X_{ip}^2\\), \\(\\text{log}(X_{ip})\\), or \\(\\text{sin}(X_{ip})\\).\n\nThe quantities \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\) are parameters, pertaining to the true but unknown data generating mechanism.\nThe estimates \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\), are statistics, calculated from our observed data.\n\nWe use statistics \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) to obtain confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to make statements about parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\).\n\nAssumptions of Normal Error Regression Model\nWhen generating data for the ice cream machine, we assumed four things:\n\nLinearity - the expected amount of ice cream dispensed (i.e the signal) is a linear function of time the dispenser was pressed.\nConstant Variance - individual amounts dispensed varied from their expected amount with equal variability, regardless of the amount of time. That is, the amount of variability in individual amounts dispensed was the same for people who held the dispenser for 1 s. as for people who held it for 2 s. or 3 s., etc.\nNormality - individual amounts dispensed varied from their expected amount in accordance with a normal distribution.\nIndependence - the amount of ice cream dispensed for one person was not affected by the amount dispensed for anyone else.\n\nMore generally, the normal error regression model assumes:\n\nLinearity - the expected response is a linear function of the explanatory variable(s).\nConstant Variance - the variance between individual values of the response variable are the same for any values/categories of the explanatory variable(s)\nNormality - for any values/categories of the explanatory variable(s) individual response values vary from their expectation in accordance with a normal distribution.\nIndependence - individual response values are not affected by one another\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Examples of Normal Error Regression Model\nWe can formulate all of the examples we’ve worked with so far in terms of the normal error regression model.\nIn the house price example, consider the following models:\nModel 1:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nIf we use this model, we’re saying that we believe the expected price of a house is a linear function of its size, and that for any given size, the distribution of actual prices are normally distributed around their expected value of \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}\\). Furthermore, we’re saying that the amount of variability in house prices is the same for houses of any size.\nModel 2:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nIf we use this model, we’re saying that we believe the expected price of a house depends only on whether or not it is on the waterfront, and that prices of both waterfront and non-waterfront houses follow normal distributions. Though these distributions may have different means (\\(\\beta_0\\) for non-waterfront houses, and \\(\\beta_1\\) for waterfront houses), the amount of variability in prices should be the same for waterfront as non-waterfront houses.\nModel 3:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nand\nModel 4:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nBoth of Models 3 and 4 assume that actual prices of houses with the same size and waterfront status are normally distributed, and that the mean of the normal distribution is a linear function of its size. Model 3 allows for the intercept of the lines to differ between waterfront and non-waterfront houses, while Model 4 allows both the intercept and slope to differ. Both assume that the amount of variability among houses of the same size and waterfront status is the same.\n\n\n4.1.6 Implications of Normal Error Regression Model\nIf we really believe that data come about as the normal error regression model describes, then probability theory tells us that regression coefficients \\(b_j\\)’s, representing differences between categories for categorical variables and rates of change for quantitative variables, follow symmetric and bell-shaped distributions. We can use this fact to create confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests, without needing to perform simulation. This is, in fact what R does in it’s model summary output.\nThese methods are only valid, however, if data can reasonably be thought of as having come from a process consistent with the assumptions of the normal error regression model process. If we don’t believe that our observed data can be reasonably thought of as having come from such a process, then the confidence intervals and p-values produced by R, and other places that rely on probability-based methods will not be reliable.\nWe close the section with a philosophical question:\nDo data really come about from processes like the normal error regression model? That is, do you think it is reasonable to believe that data we see in the real world (perhaps the amount of ice cream dispensed by an ice cream machine) represent independent outcomes of a process in which expected outcomes are a linear function of explanatory variables, and deviate from their expectation according to a normal distribution with constant variance?\nWe won’t attempt to answer that question here, but it is worth thinking about. After all, it is an assumption on which many frequently employed methods of statistical inference depends.",

    "text": "4.2 Standard Error and Confidence Intervals\n\n4.2.1 Common Standard Error Formulas\nIn the normal error regression model, \\(\\sigma\\) is an unknown model parameter representing the standard deviation in response values among cases with the same values/categories of explanatory variable(s). We estimate \\(\\sigma\\) using the statistic\n\\(s =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}}\\).\n\\(s\\) is not the same as the standard errors of statistics we estimated using bootstrapping in Chapter 3. It is, however, related to these standard errors. In fact, standard errors for common statistics like sample means, differences in means, and regression coefficients can be approximated using formulas involving \\(s\\).\nSo far, we’ve used simulation (permutation tests and bootstrap intervals) to determine the amount of variability associated with a test statistic or estimate, in order to perform hypotheses tests and create confidence intervals. In special situations, there are mathematical formulas, based on probability theory, that can be used to approximate these standard errors without having to perform the simulations.\nTheory-Based Standard Error Formulas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic\nStandard Error\n\n\n\n\nSingle Mean\n\\(SE(b_0)=\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\nDifference in Means\n\\(SE(b_j)=s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\nSingle Proportion\n\\(SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\)\n\n\nDifference in Proportions\n\\(SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p_1}(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{\\hat{p_2}(1-\\hat{p_2})}{n_2}\\right)}\\)\n\n\nIntercept in Simple Linear Regression\n\\(SE(b_0)=s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\\)\n\n\nSlope in Simple Linear Regression\n\\(SE(b_1)=\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\frac{{\\sum(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{(n-(p+1))}}\\), (p is number of regression coefficients not including \\(b_0\\)). \\(s\\) is an estimate of the variability in the response variable among cases where the explanatory variable(s) are the same. Note that in the one-sample case, this simplifies to the standard deviation formula we’ve seen previously.\nIn the 2nd formula, the standard error estimate \\(s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1+n_2}}\\) is called a “pooled” estimate since it combines information from all groups. When there is reason to believe standard deviation differs between groups, we often use an “unpooled” standard error estimate of \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\), where \\(s_1, s_2\\) represent the standard deviation for groups 1 and 2. This can be used in situations where the explanatory variable is categorical and we have doubts about the constant variance assumption.\n\nThere is no theory-based formula for standard error associated with the median or standard deviation. For these, and many other statistics, we rely on simulation to estimate variability between samples.\nThere are formulas for standard errors associated with coefficients in multiple regression, but these require mathematics beyond what is assumed in this class. They involve linear algebra and matrix inversion, which you can read about here if you are interested.\nWhen the sampling distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, approximate 95% confidence intervals can be calculated using the formula,\n\\[\n\\text{Statistic} \\pm 2\\times \\text{Standard Error},\n\\]\nwhere the standard error is estimated using a formula, rather than through bootstrapping.\nWe’ll go through some examples to illustrate how to calculate and interpret \\(s\\) and \\(SE(b_j)\\).\n\n\n4.2.2 Example: Difference in Means\nWe’ll use the normal error regression model to predict a lake’s mercury level, using location (N vs S) as the explanatory variable.\nThe regression model is:\n\\[\n\\text{Mercury} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 \\times\\text{Location}_{\\text{South}} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\]\nThis model assumes:\n\nLinearity - there is no linearity assumption when the explanatory variable is categorical.\nConstant Variance - the variance between mercury levels of individual lakes is the same for Northern Florida, as for Southern Florida.\nNormality - mercury levels are normally distributed in Northern Florida and also in Southern Florida.\nIndependence - mercury levels of individual lakes are not affected by those of other lakes.\n\nThe lm summary command in R returns information pertaining to the model.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_loc &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury ~ Location)\nsummary(M_Lakes_merc_loc)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

These tell us how much these statistics are expected to vary between samples of the given size.\nEstimating \\(\\text{SE}(b_0)\\) and \\(\\text{SE}(b_1)\\)\nWe’ll use the theory-based formulas to calculate the standard errors for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\).\nIn this case, \\(b_0\\) represents a single mean, the mean mercury level for lakes in Northern Florida. Since there are 33 such lakes, the calculation is:\n\\(SE(b_0)=\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{0.317}{\\sqrt{33}} \\approx 0.055\\)\nThe standard error of intercept \\(b_0\\) is 0.055.

For example, if we believe there might be more variability in mercury levels among lakes with higher pH levels than lower ones (a violation of the constant variance assumption), or that lakes closer together are likely to have similar mercury levels (a violation of the independence assumption) then the results of the model might not be reliable.\nLater in this chapter, we’ll learn ways to check the appropriateness of these assumptions. For now, we’ll assume that the model is a reasonable enough approximation of reality and use it accordingly.\nThe lm summary command in R returns information pertaining to the model.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_pH &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury ~ pH)\nsummary(M_Lakes_merc_pH)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ pH, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.48895 -0.19188 -0.05774  0.09456  0.71134 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The t-distribution depends on a parameter called degrees of freedom, which determines the thickness of the distribution’s tails.\nWhen the sampling distribution for a statistic is symmetric and bell-shaped, it can be approximated by a t-distribution. As the sample size increases, so do the degrees of freedom in the t-distribution.\nAs the degrees of freedom grow large, we see that the t-distributions get closer together, converging to a bell-shaped curve. This distribution is called a standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 t-tests\nWhen the sampling distribution of a statistic is symmetric and bell-shaped, then the ratio\n\\[\nt= \\frac{{\\text{Statistic}}}{\\text{SE}(\\text{Statistic})}  \n\\]\napproximately follows a t-distribution.\nThe statistic \\(t\\) is called a t-statistic.\nWe’ll use this t-statistic as the test statistic in our hypothesis test.\nThe degrees of freedom are given by \\(n-(p+1)\\), where \\(p\\) represents the number of terms in the model, not including the intercept.\nTo find a p-value, we use a t-distribution to find the probability of obtaining a t-statistic as or more extreme than the one calculated from our data.\nA hypothesis test based on the t-statistic and t-distribution is called a t-test.\n\n\n4.3.3 t-test Examples\n\n4.3.3.1 Example 1: N vs S Lakes\nThe equation of the model is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Mercury}} = b_0+b_1\\times\\text{South}\n\\]\nWe fit the model in R and display its summary output below.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_loc &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~Location)\nsummary(M_Lakes_merc_loc)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The last two columns, labeled t value and “Pr(&gt;|t|)” represent the t-statistic and p-value for the t-test associated with the null hypothesis that the regression parameter on that line is zero. (i.e. \\(\\beta_j=0\\)).\nt-test for line LocationS\nTo test whether there is evidence of a difference in mercury levels between Northern and Southern Florida, we’ll test the null hypothesis (\\(\\beta_1=0\\)). This corresponds to the locationS line of the R output.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average mercury levels between Northern and Southern Florida (\\(\\beta_1=0\\)).\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average mercury levels in Northern and Southern Florida (\\(\\beta_1\\neq 0\\)).\nIn the previous section, we calculated the standard error for \\(b_1\\) to be 0.0898, respectively.\nTest Statistic: \\(t=\\frac{{b_j}}{\\text{SE}(b_j)} = \\frac{0.27195}{0.0898} = 3.027\\)\nTo calculate the p-value, we plot the t-statistic of 3.027 that we observed in our data and observe where it lies on a t-distribution.\n\nts=3.027\ngf_dist(\"t\", df=51, geom = \"area\", fill = ~ (abs(x)&lt; abs(ts)), show.legend=FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept=c(ts, -ts), color=\"red\")  + xlab(\"t\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pt function returns the probability of getting a t-statistic higher than 3.027.

Both lead us to the conclusion that there is evidence of a difference in mean mercury level between lakes in Northern Florida and Southern Florida.\nHypothesis Test for line (intercept)\nNotice that there is also a t-statistic and p-value on the line (intercept). This is testing the following hypotheses.\nNull Hypothesis: The average mercury level among all lakes in North Florida is 0 (\\(\\beta_0=0\\)).\nAlternative Hypothesis: The average mercury level among all lakes in Northern Florida is not 0 (\\(\\beta_0\\neq 0\\)).\nWe could carry out this test by dividing the estimate by its standard error and finding the p-value using a t-distribution, just like we did for \\(\\beta_1\\). However, we already know that the average mercury level among all lakes in North Florida is certainly not 0, so this is a silly test, and we shouldn’t conclude much from it.\nNot every p-value that R provides is actually meaningful or informative.\n\n\n4.3.3.2 Example 2: Regression Slope\nWe revisit the model predicting a lake’s mercury level, using pH as the explanatory variable.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_pH &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~pH)\nsummary(M_Lakes_merc_pH)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ pH, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.48895 -0.19188 -0.05774  0.09456  0.71134 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

(\\(\\beta_0=0\\)).\nAlternative Hypothesis: The average mercury level among all Florida lakes with pH = 0 not 0. (\\(\\beta_0 \\neq 0\\)).\nSince there are no lakes with pH level 0, this is not a meaningful test. Although a p-value is provided in the R-output, it is not meaningful and we should not try to draw conclusions from it.\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Limitations of Model-Based Inference\nWe’ve seen that in situations where the sampling distribution for a regression coefficient \\(b_j\\) is symmetric and bell-shaped, we can create confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests using the t-distribution without performing permutation for hypothesis tests, or bootstrapping for confidence intervals.\nThere are, however, limitations to this approach, which underscore the importance of the simulation-based approaches seen in Chapter 3.\nThese include:\n\nThere are lots of statistics, like medians and standard deviations, that do not have known standard error formulas, and do not follow symmetric bell-shaped distributions. In more advanced and complicated models, it is common to encounter statistics of interest with unknown sampling distributions. In these cases, we can estimate p-values and build confidence intervals via simulation, even if we cannot identify the distribution by name.\nEven for statistics with known standard error formulas, the t-test is only appropriate when the sampling distribution for \\(b_j\\) is symmetric and bell-shaped. While there is probability theory that shows this will happen when the sample size is “large enough,” there is no set sample size that guarantees this. Datasets with heavier skewness in the response variable will require larger sample sizes than datasets with less skewness in the response.\nThe simulation-based approaches provide valuable insight to the logic behind hypothesis tests. When we permute values of an explanatory variable in a hypothesis test it is clear that we are simulating a situation where the null hypothesis is true. Likewise, when we simulate taking many samples in bootstrapping, it is clear that we are assessing the variability in a statistic across samples. Simply jumping to the t-based approximations of these distributions makes it easy to lose our sense of what they actually represent, and thus increases the likelihood of interpreting them incorrectly.\n\nIn fact prominent statistician R.A. Fisher wrote of simulation-based methods in 1936:\n“Actually, the statistician does not carry out this very simple and very tedious process, but his conclusions have no justification beyond the fact that they agree with those which could have been arrived at by this elementary method.”\nFisher’s comment emphasizes the fact that probability-based tests, like the t-test are simply approximations to what we would obtain via simulation-based approaches, which were not possible in his day, but are now.\nProponents of simulation-based inference include Tim Hesterberg, Senior Statistician at Instacart, and former Senior Statistician at Google, which heavily used simulation-based tests associated with computer experiments associated with their search settings. Hesterberg wrote a 2015 paper, arguing for the use and teaching of simulation-based techniques.\nWe will move forward by using probability-based inference where appropriate, while understanding that we are merely approximating what we would obtain via simulation. Meanwhile, we’ll continue to employ simulation-based approaches where probability-based techniques are inappropriate or unavailable.",

    "text": "4.5 lm Summary in R\nWe’ve now seen how to obtain all of the quantities shown in the lm summary output in R. This section does not provide any new information, but brings together all of the information from the previous sections and chapters to show, in one place, how the lm summary output is obtained.\n\n4.5.1 lm summary Output\nThe summary command for a linear model in R displays a table including 4 columns.\nLinear Model summary() Output in R\n\nEstimate gives the least-squares estimates \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\)\nStandard Error gives estimates of the standard deviation in the sampling distribution for estimate. It tells us how the estimate is expected to vary between different samples of the given size. These are computed using the formulas in Section 4.2.\nt value is the estimate divided by its standard error.\nPr(&gt;|t|) is a p-value for the hypothesis test associated with the null hypothesis \\(\\beta_j = 0\\), where \\(\\beta_j\\) is the regression coefficient pertaining to the given line. Note that \\(\\beta_j\\) is the unknown population parameter estimated by \\(b_j\\).\nThe Residual Standard Error is \\(s =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}}\\). This is an estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), which represents the standard deviation in the distribution of the response variable for given value(s) or category(ies) of explanatory variable(s). It tells us how much variability is expected in the response variable between different individuals with the same values/categories of the explanatory variables.\nThe degrees of freedom are \\(n-(p+1)\\).\nThe Multiple R-Squared value is the \\(R^2\\) value seen in Chapter 2. \\(R^2 = \\frac{\\text{SST} -\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y}_i)^2}\\)\nWe know that \\(R^2\\) can never decrease when additional variables are added to a model. The Adjusted-R^2 value is an alternate version of \\(R^2\\) that is designed to penalize adding variables that do little to explain variation in the response.\nThe F-statistic on the bottom line of the R-output corresponds to an F-test of the given model against a reduced model that include no explanatory variables. The p-value on this line is associated with the test of the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the response variable and any of the explanatory variables. Since SSR for this reduced model is equal to SST, the F-statistic calculation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ F=\\frac{\\frac{SST - SSR}{p}}{\\frac{SSR}{n-(p+1)}} \\]\nThe degrees of freedom associated with the F-statistic are given by \\(p\\) and \\((n-(p+1))\\).\nExample: Northern vs Southern Florida Lakes\nRecall our linear model for mercury levels of lakes in Northern Florida, compared to Southern Florida.\nThe equation of the model is:\n\\[\\text{Mercury} = \\beta\\_0+\\beta_1\\times\\text{South} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\]\nWe fit the model in R and display its summary output below.\n\nM_Lakes_merc_loc &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~Location)\nsummary(M_Lakes_merc_loc)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "4.6 Intervals for Expected Response\n\n4.6.1 Parameter Values and Expected Responses\nRecall that in Chapter 4, we saw two different types of confidence intervals. One type was for regression parameters, \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\), using estimate \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\). The other type was for expected responses, which involved estimating linear functions of these parameters, for example \\(\\beta_0 + 7\\beta_1\\).\nUnder the assumptions of a normal error regression model, we an approximate 95% confidence interval for regression parameter \\(\\beta_j\\) is given by\n\\[ b_j  \\pm t^*\\text{SE}(b_j), \\]\nwhere \\(t^*\\approx 2\\).\nWe’ve seen that in R, confidence intervals for regression parameters can be obtained through the confint() command.\nA 95% confidence interval for an expected response \\(E(Y_i|X_{i1}=x_{i1}, \\ldots X_{ip}=x_{ip}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_px_{ip}\\) is estimated by\n\\[ b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip} \\pm t^*\\text{SE}(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}), \\]\nIn this section, we’ll look more into confidence intervals for expected responses and also another kind of interval involving expected responses, called a prediction interval.\nWell sometimes write \\(E(Y_i|X_{i1}=x_{i1}, \\ldots X_{ip}=x_{ip})\\) as \\(E(Y|X)\\).\n\n\n4.6.2 Estimation and Prediction\nRecall the ice cream dispenser that is known to dispense ice cream at a rate of 2 oz. per second on average, with individual amounts varying according to a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5\nConsider the following two questions:\n\nOn average, how much ice cream will be dispensed for people who press the dispenser for 1.5 seconds?\nIf a single person presses the dispenser for 1.5 seconds, how much ice cream will be dispensed?\n\nThe first question is one of estimation. The second pertains to prediction.\nWhen estimating expected responses and making predictions on new observations, there are two sources of variability we must consider.\n\nWe are using data to estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), which introduces sampling variability.\n\nEven if we did know \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), there is variability in individual observations, which follows a \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) distribution.\n\nIn an estimation problem, we only need to think about (1). When predicting the value of a single new observation, we need to think about both (1) and (2).\nThus, intervals for predictions of individual observations carry more uncertainty and are wider than confidence intervals for \\(E(Y|X)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2.1 Example: Ice Cream Machine\nIn the estimation setting, we are trying to determine the location of the regression line for the entire population. Uncertainty comes from the fact that we only have data from a sample.\nIn the ice cream example, we can see that the blue line, fit to our data, is a good approximation of the “true” regression line that pertains to the mechanism from which the data were generated. It does, however, vary from the red line slightly due to sampling variability.\n\nggplot(data=Icecream1, aes(x=time, y=amount)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Icecream Dispensed\") + xlab(\"Time Pressing dispenser\") + ylab(\"Amount Dispensed\") + geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, color=\"red\") + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(IC_Model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lm(amount ~ time), data = Icecream1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-0.8645 -0.3553  0.0685  0.2252  0.6963 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It is of the form, for a given \\(X\\), on average what do we expect to be true of \\(Y\\).\nIn the ice cream question, we can answer this exactly, since we know \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nIn a real situation, we don’t know these and have to estimate them from the data, which introduces uncertainty.\nConfidence interval for \\(E(Y | (X=x))\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*SE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) \\\\\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*\\sqrt{\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe second question is a question of prediction. Even if we knew the true values of \\(beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), we would not be able to given the exact amount dispensed for an individual user, since this varies between users.\nPrediction interval for \\(E(Y | (X=x))\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*\\sqrt{\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) + s^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe extra \\(s^2\\) in the calculation of prediction variance comes from the uncertainty associated with individual observations.\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Intervals in R\nIn R, we can obtain confidence intervals for an expected response and prediction intervals for an individual response using the predict command, with either interval=\"confidence\" or interval=\"prediction\".\n\npredict(IC_Model, newdata=data.frame(time=1.5), interval = \"confidence\", level=0.95)\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 2.916965 2.523728 3.310201\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that the mean amount of ice cream dispensed when the dispenser is held for 1.5 seconds is between 2.52 and 3.31 oz.\n\npredict(IC_Model, newdata=data.frame(time=1.5), interval = \"prediction\", level=0.95)\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 2.916965 1.862832 3.971097\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that in individual who holds the dispenser for 1.5 seconds will get between 1.86 and 3.97 oz of ice cream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prediction interval (in red) is wider than the confidence interval (in blue), since it must account for variability between individuals, in addition to sampling variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.4 SLR Calculations (Optional)\nIn simple linear regression,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) = s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x^*-\\bar{x})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus a confidence interval for \\(E(Y | (X=x))\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*SE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) \\\\\n& = b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x^*-\\bar{x})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}  \\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA prediction interval for \\(E(Y | (X=x))\\) is:\n\\[\nb_0 + b_1x^* \\pm t^* s\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x^*-\\bar{x})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\right) + 1}\n\\]\nCalculations in Ice cream example\nFor \\(x=1.5\\), a confidence interval is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*SE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) \\\\\n& = b_0+b_1x^* \\pm 2s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x^*-\\bar{x})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}  \\\\\n& = -0.1299087 + 2.0312489 \\pm 20.4527185 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{15}+ \\frac{(1.5-2.3733)^2}{8.02933}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA prediction interval is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*SE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) \\\\\n& = b_0+b_1x^* \\pm 2s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x^*-\\bar{x})^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}  \\\\\n& = -0.1299087 + 2.0312489 \\pm 20.4527185 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{15}+ \\frac{(1.5-2.3733)^2}{8.02933}\\right)+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n4.6.5 Car Price and Acceleration Time\nWe consider data from the Kelly Blue Book, pertaining to new cars, released in 2015.

The flight instructors observed that “high praise for good execution of complex maneuvers typically results in a decrement of performance on the next try.”\nKahneman and Tversky write that :\n“We normally reinforce others when their behavior is good and punish them when their behavior is bad. By regression alone, therefore, they [the trainees] are most likely to improve after being punished and most likely to deteriorate after being rewarded. Consequently, we are exposed to a lifetime schedule in which we are most often rewarded for punishing others, and punished for rewarding.”",

    "text": "4.8 Responsible Statistical Inference\nWhile statistics offer insight that have lead to great advances in science, medicine, business and economics and many other areas, they have also been misused, (either intentionally or unintentionally) in ways that have resulted in harm. In an effort to better educate the public, the American Statistical Association released a report in 2016, highlighting common misuses of p-values, and the notion of statistical significance. Kenneth Rothman, Professor of Epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health wrote:\n\n“(S)cientists have embraced and even avidly pursued meaningless differences solely because they are statistically significant, and have ignored important effects because they failed to pass the screen of statistical significance…It is a safe bet that people have suffered or died because scientists (and editors, regulators, journalists and others) have used significance tests to interpret results, and have consequently failed to identify the most beneficial courses of action.” -ASA statement on p-values, 2016\n\nIn this section, we’ll look at some real scenarios where it might be tempting to make an improper conclusion based on data. Think carefully about each scenario and identify possible misinterpretations that might arise. Then think about what conclusions or actions would be appropriate in each scenario.\nKeep in mind the following guidelines for responsible statistical inference.\nWhat a p-value tells us\nPerforming responsible statistical inference requires understanding what p-values do and do not tell us, and how they should and should not be interpreted.\n\nA low p-value tells us that the data we observed are inconsistent with our null hypothesis or some assumption we make in our model.\nA large p-value tells us that the data we observed could have plausibly been obtained under our supposed model and null hypothesis.\nA p-value never provides evidence supporting the null hypothesis, it only tells us the strength of evidence against it.\nA p-value is impacted by\n\nthe size of the difference between group, or change per unit increase (effect size)\n\nthe amount of variability in the data\n\nthe sample size\n\nSometimes, a p-value tells us more about sample size, than relationship we’re actually interested in.\nA p-value does not tell us the “size” of a difference or effect, or whether it is practically meaningful.\nWe should only generalize results from a hypothesis test performed on a sample to a larger population or process if the sample is representative of the population or process (such as when the sample is randomly selected).\nA correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.\n\n\n4.8.1 Breakfast Cereals and Sex of Babies\nThe title of a 2008 article by New Scientist makes a surprising claim: “Breakfast cereals boost chances of conceiving boys.” Although the article lacks details on the underlying study, researchers, in fact, tracked the eating habits of women who were attempting to become pregnant. They tracked 133 different food items, and tested whether there was a difference in the proportion of baby boys conceived between women who ate the food, compared to those who didn’t. Of the 133 foods tested, only breakfast cereal showed a significant difference.\nQuestion: Why is the researcher’s conclusion that eating breakfast cereal increases the chances of conceiving a boy inappropriate? Hint: think about how this situation is similar to the one in the xkcd comic?\nA statistical procedure called the Bonferroni Correction suggests that when more than one test is performed simultaneously, we should multiply observed p-values by the number of tests performed. Why might this help prevent errors? Do you see any downsides of doing this?\n\n\n4.8.2 Flights from New York to Chicago\nA traveler lives in New York and wants to fly to Chicago.

    "section": "5.1 Checking Regression Assumptions",
    "text": "5.1 Checking Regression Assumptions\nWe’ve seen that tests and intervals based on the normal error regression model depend on four assumptions. If these assumptions are not reasonable then the tests and intervals may not be reliable.\nThe statement \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1}+ \\ldots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\epsilon_i\\), with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\) implies the following:\n\nLinearity: the expected value of \\(Y\\) is a linear function of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\). (This assumption is only relevant for models including at least one quantitative explanatory variable.)\nNormality: Given the values of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\), \\(Y\\) follows a normal distribution.\nConstant Variance: Regardless of the values of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\), the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for \\(Y\\) is the same.\nIndependence: The response value for each observation is not affected by any of the other observations (expect due to explanatory variables included in the model).\n\nIllustration of Model Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that these assumptions held true in the ice cream example, because we generated the data in a way that was consistent with these.\nIn practice, we will have only the data, without knowing the exact mechanism that produced it. We should only rely on the t-distribution based p-values and confidence intervals in the R output if these appear to be reasonable assumptions.\nOf course, these assumptions will almost never be truly satisfied, but they should at least be a reasonable approximation if we are to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n5.1.1 Checking Model Assumptions\nThe following plots are useful when assessing the appropriateness of the normal error regression model.\n\nScatterplot of residuals against predicted values\nHistogram of standardized residuals\n\nheavy skewness indicates a problem with normality assumption\n\nNormal quantile plot\n\nsevere departures from diagonal line indicate problem with normality assumption\n\n\nResidual vs Predicted Plots\nA residual vs predicted plot is useful for detecting issues with the linearity or constant variance assumption.\n\ncurvature indicates a problem with linearity assumption\n\n“funnel” or “megaphone” shape indicates problem with constant variance assumption\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=no_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=lin_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Linearity Assumption\")+ xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=cvar_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Constant Variance Assumption\")+ xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is only one explanatory variable, plotting the residuals against that variable reveals the same information as a residual vs predicted plot.\nHistogram of Residuals\nA histogram of the residuals is useful for assessing the normality assumption.\n\nSevere skewness indicates violation of normality assumption\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(x=no_viol_Model$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") +xlab(\"Residual\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(x=norm_viol_Model$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Normality Assumption\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot\nSometimes histograms can be inconclusive, especially when sample size is smaller.\nA Normal quantile-quantile plot displays quantiles of the residuals against the expected quantiles of a normal distribution.\n\nSevere departures from diagonal line indicate a problem with normality assumption.\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(sample = scale(no_viol_Model$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") + xlim(c(-4,4)) + ylim(c(-4,4))\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(sample = scale(norm_viol_Model$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Violation of Normality Assumption\") + xlim(c(-4,4)) + ylim(c(-4,4))\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Model Assumptions - Independence\nIndependence is often difficult to assess through plots of data, but it is important to think about whether there were factors in the data collection that would cause some observations to be more highly correlated than others.\nFor example:\n\nPeople in the study who are related.\n\nSome plants grown in the same greenhouse and others in different greenhouses.\n\nSome observations taken in same time period and others at different times.\n\nAll of these require more complicated models that account for correlation using spatial and time structure.\n\n\n5.1.2 Summary of Checks for Model Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel assumption\nHow to detect violation\n\n\n\n\nLinearity\nCurvature in residual plot\n\n\nConstant Variance\nFunnel shape in residual plot\n\n\nNormality\nSkewness in histogram of residuals or departure from diag. line in QQ plot\n\n\nIndependence\nNo graphical check, carefully examine data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Example: N v S Lakes\nRecall our sample of 53 Florida Lakes, 33 in the north, and 20 in the south.\n\\(\\text{Mercury}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times{\\text{South}_i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\).\n\nLakesBP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use the normal error regression model, we are assuming the following:\n\nLinearity: there is an expected mercury concentration for lakes in North Florida, and another for lakes in South Florida.\nNormality: mercury concentrations of individual lakes in the north are normally distributed, and so are mercury concentrations in the south. These normal distributions might have different means.\nConstant Variance: the normal distribution for mercury concentrations in North Florida has the same standard deviation as the normal distribution for mercury concentrations in South Florida\nIndependence: no two lakes are any more alike than any others, except for being in the north or south, which we account for in the model. We might have concerns about this, do to some lakes being geographically closer to each other than others.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nA residual by predicted plot, histogram of residuals, and normal quantile-quantile plot are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=M_Lakes_merc_loc$residuals, x=M_Lakes_merc_loc$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(x=M_Lakes_merc_loc$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(sample = scale(M_Lakes_merc_loc$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we see two lines of predicted values and residuals. This makes sense since all lakes in North Florida will have the same predicted value, as will all lakes in Southern Florida.\nThere appears to be a little more variability in residuals for Southern Florida (on the right), than Northern Florida, causing some concern about the constant variance assumption.\nOverall, though, the assumptions seem mostly reasonable.\nWe shouldn’t be concerned about using theory-based hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for the mean mercury level or difference in mean mercury levels. There might be some concern that prediction intervals could be either too wide or too narrow, but this is not a major concern, since the constant variance assumption is not severe.\n\n\n5.1.4 Example: pH Model\nRecall the regression line estimating the relationship between a lake’s mercury level and pH.\n\\(\\text{Mercury}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times\\text{pH}_i + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\).\nThe model assumes:\n\nLinearity: the expected mercury level of a lake is a linear function of pH.\nNormality: for any given pH, the mercury levels of lakes with that pH follow a normal distribution. For example, mercury levels for lakes with pH of 6 is are normally distributed, and mercury levels for lakes with pH of 9 are normally distributed, though these normal distributions may have different means.\nConstant Variance: the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for mercury level is the same for each pH. For example, there is the same amount of variability associated with lakes with pH level 6, as pH level 8.\nIndependence: no two lakes are any more alike than any others, except with respect to pH, which is accounted for in the model. This may not be a reasonable assumption, but it’s unclear what the effects of such a violation would be.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nThe plots for checking these assumptions are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=M_pH$residuals, x=M_pH$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(x=M_pH$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(sample = scale(M_pH$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residual vs predicted plot does not show any linear trend, and variability appears to be about the same for low predicted values as for high ones. Thus, the linearity and constant variance assumptions appear reasonable.\nThe histogram shows some right-skewness, and the right-most points on the normal-qq plot are above the line, indicating a possible concern with the normality assumption. There is some evidence of right-skewness, which might impact the appropriatness of the normal error regression model.\nNevertheless, we obtained similar results using the simulation-based results as the normal error regression model, suggesting that the concern about normality did not have much impact on the estimation of \\(\\beta_1\\). It is possible that this concern could have implications for other kinds of inference, such as confidence intervals for an expected response, and prediction intervals, which we’ll explore later in the chapter.\n\n\n5.1.5 Example: House Prices\nRecall the model for estimating price of a house, using size, waterfront status, and an interaction term.\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nThe model assumes:\n\nLinearity: the expected price of a house is a linear function of its size. The slope and intercept of this function may be different for houses on the waterfront, compared to houses not on the waterfront.\nNormality: prices of houses of a given size and waterfront status are normally distributed.\nConstant Variance: the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for prices is the same for all sizes and waterfront statuses.\nIndependence: no two houses are any more alike than any others, except with respect to size and waterfront status.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nSeveral reasons come to mind that might cause us to doubt the validity of these assumptions, but let’s investigate them emperically, using our data on 100 houses.\nThe plots for checking these assumptions are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(y=M_House_Int$residuals, x=M_House_Int$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=M_House_Int$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(sample = scale(M_House_Int$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we might have had some initial concerns about the model assumptions, the plots do not raise any serious concerns. There is no sign of a nonlinear relationship in the residual vs predicted plot, so the linearity assumption appears reasonable.\nThere is possibly more variability associated with prices or more expensive houses than less expensive ones, so we might have some concerns about constant variance, but since there are only a few very high-priced houses, and the increasing variance is not too severe, this may not be much of a concern.\nThere are a few houses on each end of the normal qq plot that deviate from their expected line, but not very many. It’s not uncommon to have a few points deviate from the line on the end, so we do not have severe concerns about normality. The histogram of residuals is roughly symmetric.\nThus, the normal error regression model appears to be reasonable for these data.\n\n\n5.1.6 Impact of Model Assumption Violations\nIn this chapter, we’ve studied the normal error regression model and its underlying assumptions. We’ve seen that when these assumptions are realistic, we can use distributions derived from probability theory, such as t and F distributions to approximate sampling distributions, in place of the simulation-based methods seen in Chapters 3 and 4.\nOf course, real data don’t come exactly from processes like the fictional ice cream dispenser described in Section 5.1, so it’s really a question of whether this model is a realistic approximation (or simplification) of the true mechanism that led to the data we observe. We can use diagnostics like residual and Normal-QQ plots, as well as our intuition and background knowledge to assess whether the normal error regression model is a reasonable approximation.\nThe p-values provided by the lm summary output, and anova commands, and the and intervals produced by the confint, and predict command, as well as many other R commands, depend on the assumptions of the normal error regression model, and should only be used when these assumptions are reasonable.\nIn situations where some model assumptions appear to be violated, we might be okay using certain tests/intervals, but not others. In general, we should proceed with caution in these situations.\nThe table below provides guidance on the potential impact of model assumption violation on predicted values, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel assumption Violated\nPredicted Values\nConfidence Intervals\nPrediction Intervals\n\n\n\n\nLinearity\nUnreliable\nUnreliable\nUnreliable\n\n\nConstant Variance\nReliable\nSomewhat unreliable - Some too wide, others too narrow\nVery unreliable - Some too wide, others too narrow\n\n\nNormality\nReliable\nPossibly unreliable - might be symmetric when they shouldn’t be.

    "text": "5.2 Transformations\nWhen there are violations of model assumptions, we can sometimes correct for these by modeling a a function of the response variable, rather than the response variable itself. When the histogram of residuals and normal qq plot show signs of right-skewness, modeling \\(log(Y)\\) is often helpful.\n\n5.2.1 Example: Modeling Car Prices\nWe’ll look at the assumptions associated with the model for predicting car price, using acceleration time as the explanatory variable.\nDiagnostic plots are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(y=Cars_M_A060$residuals, x=Cars_M_A060$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(x=Cars_M_A060$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(sample = scale(Cars_M_A060$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a funnel-shape in the residual plot, indicating a concern about the constant variance assumption. There appears to be more variability in prices for more expensive cars than for cheaper cars. There is also some concern about the normality assumption, as the histogram and QQ plot indicate right-skew in the residuals.\n\n\n5.2.2 Log Transformation\nWhen residual plots yield model inadequacy, we might try to correct these by applying a transformation to the response variable.\nWhen working a nonnegative, right-skewed response variable, it is often helpful to work with the logarithm of the response variable.\nNote: In R, log() denotes the natural (base e) logarithm, often denoted ln(). We can actually use any logarithm, but the natural logarithm is commonly used.\nWe’ll use the model:\n\\[\n\\text{Log Price} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times \\text{Acc060} + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\]\nThe plot shows log(price) on the y-axis.

It also gives non-symmetric intervals. These results appear to be consistent with the observed data.\n\n\n5.2.7 Comments on Transformations\n\nWe could have used another transformation, such as \\(\\sqrt{\\text{Price}}\\)\nThe log tranform leads to a nice interpretation involving percent change. Other transformations might yield better predictions, but are often hard to interpret.\nThere is often a tradeoff between model complexity and interpretability. We’ll talk more about this.\nWe did an example of a transformation in a model with a single explanatory variable.\nIf the explanatory variable is categorical:\n\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the expected response in the baseline category\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_j}\\) represents the number of times larger the expected response in category \\(j\\) is, compared to the baseline category.\n\nWhen working with multiple regression models, it is still important to mention holding other variables constant when interpreting parameters associated with one of the variables.",

    "text": "5.4 Models with Interaction\n\n5.4.1 Definition of Interaction\nWe previously used a multiple regression model of the form\n\\[\n\\widehat{Price} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{SqFt} + b_2\\times\\text{Waterfront}\n\\]\nRecall that this model assumes the slope relating price and square footage is the same (\\(b_1\\)) for houses on the waterfront as for houses not on the waterfront. An illustration of the model is shown below.\n\nPlot_House_price_sqft_wf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assumption of the rate of change in price with respect to living space being the same for waterfront houses, as for non-waterfront houses might be unrealistic.\nLet’s fit separate lines waterfront and non-waterfront houses, without requiring them to have the same slope.\n\nggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=sqft_living, y=price, color=waterfront)) + geom_point()+stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + ylim(c(0,1000)) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that the prices of the houses on the waterfront are increasing more rapidly, with respect to square feet of living space, than the non-waterfront houses. The effect of additional square feet on the price of the house appears to depend on whether or not the house is on the waterfront. This is an example of an interaction between square footage and waterfront status.\nAn interaction between two explanatory variables occurs when the effect of one explanatory variable on the response depends on the other explanatory variable.\n\n\n5.4.2 Interaction Term\nIf we want to allow for different slopes between waterfront and non-waterfront houses, we’ll need to change the mathematical equation of our model. To do that, we’ll add a coefficient \\(b_3\\), multiplied by the product of our two explanatory variables.\nThe model equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{Price} = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft.} + b_2\\times\\text{waterfront} + b_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft}\\times\\text{Waterfront}\n\\]\nThe last term is called an interaction term.\nFor a house on the waterfront (\\(\\text{waterfront}=1\\)), the equation relating price to square feet is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{Price} & = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft.} + b_2\\times\\text{1} + b_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft}\\times\\text{1} \\\\\n& = (b_0+b_2) + (b_1+b_3)\\times{\\text{Sq. Ft.}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For a house not on the waterfront (\\(\\text{waterfront}=0\\)), the equation relating price to square feet is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{Price} & = b_0 + b_1\\times\\text{Sq. Ft.} + b_2\\times\\text{0} + b_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft}\\times\\text{0} \\\\\n& = b_0 + b_1\\times{\\text{Sq. Ft}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe intercept is \\(b_0\\) for non-waterfront houses, and \\(b_0 + b_2\\) for waterfront houses.\nThe slope is \\(b_1\\) for non-waterfront houses, and \\(b_1 + b_3\\) for waterfront houses.\nThus, the model allows both the slope and intercept to differ between waterfront and non-waterfront houses.\n\n\n5.4.3 Interaction Models in R\nTo fit an interaction model in R, use * instead of +\n\nM_House_Int &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~sqft_living*waterfront)\nM_House_Int\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = price ~ sqft_living * waterfront, data = Houses)\n\nCoefficients:\n              (Intercept)                sqft_living  \n                -114.3735                     0.3099  \n            waterfrontYes  sqft_living:waterfrontYes  \n                 -90.1153                     0.2729  \n\n\nThe regression equation is\n\\[\n\\widehat{Price} = 67.4 + 0.2184\\times\\text{Sq.

Ft.}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Interpretation\nWhen interpreting \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), we need to state that the interpretations apply only to the “baseline” category (in this case non-waterfront houses).\nIn a model with interaction, it does not make sense to talk about holding one variable constant when interpreting the effect of the other, since the effect of one variable depends on the value or category of the other. Instead, we must state the value or category of one variable when interpreting the effect of the other.\nInterpretations:\n\n\\(b_0\\) - On average, a house with 0 square feet that is not on the waterfront is expected to cost 67 thousand dollars. This is not a sensible interpretation since there are no houses with 0 square feet.\n\\(b_1\\) - For each additional square foot in size, the price of a non-waterfront house is expected to increase by 0.2184 thousand dollars.\n\\(b_2\\) - On average, the price of a waterfront house with 0 square feet is expected to be 364.6 thousand dollars less than the price of a non-waterfront house with 0 square feet. This is not a sensible interpretation in this case.\n\\(b_3\\) - For each additional square foot in size, the price of a waterfront house is expected to increase by 0.4327 thousand dollars more than a non-waterfront house.\n\nAlternatively, we could interpret \\(b_0+b_2\\) and \\(b_1+b_3\\) together.\n\n\\(b_0 + b_2\\) - On average, a house with 0 square feet that is on the waterfront is expected to cost -297.2 thousand dollars. This is not a sensible interpretation since there are no houses with 0 square feet.\n\\(b_1 + b_3\\) - For each additional square foot in size, the price of a waterfront house is expected to increase by 0.6511 thousand dollars.\n\nPrediction\nWe calculate predicted prices for the following houses:\n\nHouses[c(1,16), ] %&gt;% select(ID, price, sqft_living, waterfront)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n     ID price sqft_living waterfront\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1    90  335.        1030 No        \n2  2141 1700         2500 Yes       \n\n\n\\[\n\\widehat{Price}_1 = 67.4 + 0.2184\\times5420  -364.6\\times0 + 0.4327\\times5420 \\times 0 = 1191 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{Price}_{16} = 67.4 + 0.2184\\times4450  -364.6\\times1 + 0.4327\\times4450 \\times 1 = 2600 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\n\n5.4.4 \\(R^2\\) for Interaction Model\nWe can calculate residuals, as well as SSR, SSM, SST, and \\(R^2\\), in the same manner we’ve seen previously.\nWe’ll perform these calculations using R.\n\nSSR_int &lt;- sum(M_House_Int$residuals^2)\nSSR_int\n\n[1] 20429024\n\n\n\\[\nSSM = SST-SSR = 69,045,634 - 10,139,974 =58,905,660.\n\\]\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{58,905,660}{69,045,634}=0.8531.\n\\]\nApproximately 85.3% of the total variability in sale price is explained by the model using square feet and waterfront status, as well as an interaction between them as the explanatory variables.\nWe calculate \\(R^2\\) directly in R.\n\nsummary(M_House_Int)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.7770731\n\n\nWe see that adding an interaction term improved the proportion of variability in house price explained by the model from 0.76 to 0.85. This is a fairly notable increase.\n\n\n5.4.5 Considerations for Using Interactions\nIt might be tempting to think we should always add an interaction term to a model when using two or more explanatory variables. After all, an interaction term is just another term added to the model, meaning that \\(R^2\\) will never go down.\nAdding an interaction term is not always a good idea, though. We saw that doing so makes interpretations more complicated. Increasing the complexity of a model also increases the risk of overfitting, potentially hurting predictive performance on new data.\nWe should only add an interaction term if we have strong reason to believe that the rate of change in the response variable with respect to one explanatory variable really does depend on the other variable. This might come from background knowledge about the subject, or consultation with an expert in the area. It could also come from data visualization, and the increase in variability in the response variable explained when an interaction term is added to the model.\nIn the house price dataset, we might expect that the price of waterfront houses might increase more rapidly as they get bigger than the price of non-waterfront houses. The fact that the lines shown in the scatterplot are not close to being parallel provides further evidence of a difference in rate of increase, providing justification for the use of an interaction term in the model. Furthermore, \\(R^2\\) increases notably (from 0.76 to 0.85), when an interaction term is added. All of these reasons support using an interaction term in this context.\nWhen examining a scatterplot, we should note that even if there is truly no interaction among all houses, the lines probably won’t be exactly parallel, due to random deviations among the sample of houses chosen. If the lines are reasonably close to parallel, then an interaction term is likely not needed.\nWe’ll look more at criteria for determining whether to add an interaction term to a model in the coming sections.\n\n\n5.4.6 Interaction vs Correlation\nIt is easy to confuse the concept of interaction with that of correlation. These are, in fact, very different concepts.\nA correlation between two variables means that as one increases, the other is more likely to increase or decrease. We only use the word correlation to describe two quantitative variables, but we could discuss the similar notion of a relationship between categorical variables.\nAn interaction between two explanatory variables means that the effect of one on the response depends on the other.\nExamples of Correlations (or relationships)\n\nHouses on the waterfront tend to be bigger than houses not on the waterfront, so there is a relationship between square feet and waterfront status.\nHouses with large amounts of living space in square feet are likely to have more bedrooms, so there is a correlation between living space and bedrooms.\nSuppose that some genres of movies (drama, comedy, action, etc.) tend to be longer than others. This is an example of a relationship between genre and length.\n\nThe fact that there is a correlation between explanatory variables is NOT a reason to add an interaction term involving those variables in a model. Correlation is something entirely different than interaction!\nExamples of Interactions\n\nAs houses on the waterfront increase in size, their price increases more rapidly than for houses not on the waterfront. This means there is an interaction between size and waterfront location.\nSuppose that the effect of additional bedrooms on price is different for houses with lots of living space than for houses with little living space. This would be an example of an interaction between living space and number of bedrooms.\nSuppose that audiences become more favorable to dramas as they get longer, but less favorable to comedies as they get longer. In this scenario, the effect of movie length on audience rating depends on the genre of the movie, indicating an interaction between length and genre.",

    "text": "5.5 Building Models for Interpretation\nSo far, we’ve dealt with models with 2 or fewer variables. Some real questions require accounting for more than two variables. In these situations, we’ll need to develop a model that is complex enough to capture the important aspects of the mechanism we’re modeling, but also simple enough for us to be able to explain and interpret. We’ll need to decide how many variables to include in the model, and whether to use transformations, or to include interaction terms.\nWe’ll examine strategies for modeling in two different contexts. In this chapter, we’ll focus on building models for situations when we want to make interpretations and draw conclusions about relationships between variables. In Chapter 7, we focus on modeling solely for the purpose of prediction, when we are not interested in making interpretations or conclusions about relationships between variables.\nWhen building a model for the purpose of interpretation, we are typically interested in investigating a research question pertaining to relationships between explanatory and response variables. We’ll need to think about things like:\n\nwhich explanatory variables should we include in the model, and how many?\n\nshould we include any interaction terms?\n\nshould we use any nonlinear terms?\n\nshould we use a transformation of the response variable?\n\nWe’ll go through a couple example to see how we can address these questions in building a model.\nKeep in mind, there is no single correct model, but there are common characteristics of a good model. While two statisticians might use different models for a given set of data, they will hopefully lead to reasonably similar conclusions if constructed carefully.\n\n5.5.1 Modeling SAT Scores\nWe’ll now look at a dataset containing education data on all 50 states. It includes the following variables.\nstate - a factor with names of each state\nexpend - expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance in public elementary and secondary schools, 1994-95 (in thousands of US dollars)\nratio - average pupil/teacher ratio in public elementary and secondary schools, Fall 1994\nsalary - estimated average annual salary of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools, 1994-95 (in thousands of US dollars)\nfrac - percentage of all eligible students taking the SAT, 1994-95\nsat - average total SAT score, 1994-95\nregion - region of the country\n\nlibrary(mosaicData)\ndata(SAT)\nSAT &lt;- SAT %&gt;% dplyr::select(-c(verbal, math))\nlibrary(Lock5Data)\ndata(\"USStates\")\nSAT &lt;- SAT %&gt;% left_join(USStates %&gt;% select(State, Region), by=c(\"state\"=\"State\")) %&gt;% rename(region = Region)\n\n\nSAT\n\n            state expend ratio salary frac  sat region\n1         Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8 1029      S\n2          Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47  934      W\n3         Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27  944      W\n4        Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6 1005      S\n5      California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45  902      W\n6        Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29  980      W\n7     Connecticut  8.817  14.4 50.045   81  908     NE\n8        Delaware  7.030  16.6 39.076   68  897     NE\n9         Florida  5.718  19.1 32.588   48  889      S\n10        Georgia  5.193  16.3 32.291   65  854      S\n11         Hawaii  6.078  17.9 38.518   57  889      W\n12          Idaho  4.210  19.1 29.783   15  979      W\n13       Illinois  6.136  17.3 39.431   13 1048     MW\n14        Indiana  5.826  17.5 36.785   58  882     MW\n15           Iowa  5.483  15.8 31.511    5 1099     MW\n16         Kansas  5.817  15.1 34.652    9 1060     MW\n17       Kentucky  5.217  17.0 32.257   11  999     MW\n18      Louisiana  4.761  16.8 26.461    9 1021      S\n19          Maine  6.428  13.8 31.972   68  896     NE\n20       Maryland  7.245  17.0 40.661   64  909     NE\n21  Massachusetts  7.287  14.8 40.795   80  907     NE\n22       Michigan  6.994  20.1 41.895   11 1033     MW\n23      Minnesota  6.000  17.5 35.948    9 1085     MW\n24    Mississippi  4.080  17.5 26.818    4 1036      S\n25       Missouri  5.383  15.5 31.189    9 1045     MW\n26        Montana  5.692  16.3 28.785   21 1009      W\n27       Nebraska  5.935  14.5 30.922    9 1050     MW\n28         Nevada  5.160  18.7 34.836   30  917      W\n29  New Hampshire  5.859  15.6 34.720   70  935     NE\n30     New Jersey  9.774  13.8 46.087   70  898     NE\n31     New Mexico  4.586  17.2 28.493   11 1015      W\n32       New York  9.623  15.2 47.612   74  892     NE\n33 North Carolina  5.077  16.2 30.793   60  865      S\n34   North Dakota  4.775  15.3 26.327    5 1107     MW\n35           Ohio  6.162  16.6 36.802   23  975     MW\n36       Oklahoma  4.845  15.5 28.172    9 1027      S\n37         Oregon  6.436  19.9 38.555   51  947      W\n38   Pennsylvania  7.109  17.1 44.510   70  880     NE\n39   Rhode Island  7.469  14.7 40.729   70  888     NE\n40 South Carolina  4.797  16.4 30.279   58  844      S\n41   South Dakota  4.775  14.4 25.994    5 1068     MW\n42      Tennessee  4.388  18.6 32.477   12 1040      S\n43          Texas  5.222  15.7 31.223   47  893      S\n44           Utah  3.656  24.3 29.082    4 1076      W\n45        Vermont  6.750  13.8 35.406   68  901     NE\n46       Virginia  5.327  14.6 33.987   65  896      S\n47     Washington  5.906  20.2 36.151   48  937      W\n48  West Virginia  6.107  14.8 31.944   17  932      S\n49      Wisconsin  6.930  15.9 37.746    9 1073     MW\n50        Wyoming  6.160  14.9 31.285   10 1001      W\n\n\nNote that the dataset is quite old (from 1994-95), so the financial information may be out of date. Nevertheless, it is useful for exploring relationships between SAT scores and other variables.\nResearch Question\nA good statistical research question should be one that has practical implications that people would care about. It should be complex enough to be worth investigating. If the answer is obvious, then there would be no need to use statistics, or scientific reasoning in general.\nFor the SAT score dataset, we’ll focus on the question:\nDo students in states that prioritize education spending achieve better SAT scores?\nWhile this may seem like a straightforward question, we’ll see that answering it properly requires careful thought and analysis.\n\n5.5.1.1 Initial Model\nOne way to measure a state’s investment in education is in how much it pays its teachers. The plot displays average SAT score against average teacher salary for all 50 US states.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes(y=sat, x=salary)) + geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + \n  ggtitle(\"Average SAT score vs Average Teacher Salary\") + \n  xlab(\"Average Teacher Salary in Thousands\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting a simple linear regression model to the data, we obtain the following:\n\nSAT_M1 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary)\nsummary(SAT_M1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-147.125  -45.354    4.073   42.193  125.279 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The low p-value suggests a relationship like this is unlikely to occur by chance, though the practical importance of a 5-point decrease in SAT score (out of 1600) seems minimal. Furthermore, only 19% of the total variation in SAT score is explained by teaching salary. Nevertheless, a person looking to argue against raising teacher salaries might use the negative estimate and low p-value as a justification for their position.\n\n\n5.5.1.2 A Deeper Investigation\nNotice that there are large discrepancies in the frac variable, representing the percentage of students taking the SAT. In Connecticut, 81% of high school students took the SAT, compared to only 6% in Arkansas.\nLet’s break the data down by the percentage of students who take the SAT. We’ll (somewhat arbitrarily), divide the states into\nLow = 0%-22%\nMedium = 22-49%\nHigh = 49-81%\n\nSAT &lt;- mutate(SAT, fracgrp = cut(frac, \n      breaks=c(0, 22, 49, 81), \n      labels=c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")))\n\nPlotting SAT score against average teacher salary in each state, we see that the picture changes.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes( y=sat, x=salary )) +geom_point() + facet_wrap(facets = ~fracgrp) +\nstat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + xlab(\"Average Teacher Salary in Thousands\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a slight positive relationship between teacher salary and SAT score in each state.\nWhile breaking up the data into these three groups helps us visualize, we’ll simply add the frac variable to the model as a quantitative variable, rather than breaking it into these arbitrary categories.\n\nSAT_M2 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary+frac)\nsummary(SAT_M2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary + frac, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-78.313 -26.731   3.168  18.951  75.590 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

While the effect of a 2 point increase per $1,000 in average teacher salary might seem small, the ~3 point decrease for each percentage point of students taking the exam is quite meaningful. According to the model, if the percentage of students taking the SAT is 10 percentage points higher than another, and the states pay their teachers the same, then the state with more people taking the exam is expected to have an average score almost 30 points lower.\nAdding percentage of students taking the exam increased the \\(R^2\\) value substantially.\nWe see that the relationship between SAT score and salary appears to reverse when we account for percentage of students taking the test. States with low percentages of people taking the SAT tend to get higher scores, as the people taking the test tend to be those who are best prepared and have strong incentive for taking it, perhaps because they are trying to get into an elite college. At the same time, states that pay their teachers more tend to have higher percentages of people taking the SAT. This may be because states that prioritize education are more likely to cover the cost of students taking the test, or even to require it. It may also be that many of the states that require the SAT are coastal states, where cost of living, and thus teacher salaries, tend to be higher in general. Thus, it appears initially that teacher salaries are negatively correlated with SAT scores, but after accounting for percentage taking the test, the trend reverses. Situations where an apparent trend disappears or reverses after accounting for another variable are called Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n\n5.5.1.3 Student-to-Teacher Ratio\nLet’s see what other possible explanatory variables we might want to add to the model. Keep in mind that our goal is to understand the relationship between teacher salary and SAT scores in the state, so we should only use variables that help us understand this relationship.\nIn addition to teacher salaries, student-to-teacher ratio might be an indication of a state’s investment in education. We’ll add student-to-teacher ratio to the model and explore whether there is evidence that hiring enough teachers to keep student-to-teacher ratio low has a benefit, in terms of SAT score.\n\nSAT_M3 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary+frac+ratio)\nsummary(SAT_M3)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary + frac + ratio, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-89.244 -21.485  -0.798  17.685  68.262 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Likewise, while student-to-teacher ratio is still negatively associated, it too has a large p-value. Also notice that \\(R^2\\) barely increased when accounting for total expenditures.\nThis happens because expenditures are highly correlated with teacher salary. States that pay their teacher more also spend more on education per pupil. The scatterplot matrix below shows a strong correlation of 0.87 between teacher salary and expenditures.\n\nSAT_Num &lt;- select_if(SAT, is.numeric)\nC &lt;- cor(SAT_Num, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\nround(C,2)\n\n       expend ratio salary  frac   sat\nexpend   1.00 -0.37   0.87  0.59 -0.38\nratio   -0.37  1.00   0.00 -0.21  0.08\nsalary   0.87  0.00   1.00  0.62 -0.44\nfrac     0.59 -0.21   0.62  1.00 -0.89\nsat     -0.38  0.08  -0.44 -0.89  1.00\n\n\n\nlibrary(corrplot)\ncorrplot(C)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these variables are highly correlated, it doesn’t make sense to talk about the effect of increasing teacher salary, while holding expenditure constant, or vice-versa. Notice the standard error on the salary line in model SAT_M4 (which includes expenditures) is more than twice as high as in SAT_M3, which did not. This happens because the model is not able to separate the effect of salary from the effect of expenditure, and thus becomes very uncertain of the effect of both, resulting in high standard errors. In addition to reducing the t-statistic, and increasing the p-value, this leads to much wider and less informative confidence intervals associated with the effect of teacher salary.\nConfidence intervals for model involving teacher salary, percentage taking the test, and student-to-teacher ratio.\n\nconfint(SAT_M3)\n\n                  2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept) 968.6691802 1147.1271438\nsalary        0.5304797    4.5744605\nfrac         -3.3727807   -2.4539197\nratio        -8.9098147   -0.3690414\n\n\nConfidence intervals for model with above variables plus expenditure.\n\nconfint(SAT_M4)\n\n                 2.5 %      97.5 %\n(Intercept) 939.486374 1152.456698\nsalary       -3.170247    6.446081\nfrac         -3.370262   -2.438699\nratio       -10.100417    2.851952\nexpend      -16.779204   25.704393\n\n\nModels with highly correlated explanatory variables suffer from multicollinearity, which increases standard errors, making the effect of variables harder to discern. When we have explanatory variables that are highly correlated (usually with correlation greater than 0.8), we should pick out just one to include in the model. In this case, we’ll stick with teacher salary.\n\n\n5.5.1.5 Check Model Assumptions\nLet’s return to the model with salary, ratio, and fraction taking test.

In fact, the vertex of the parabola given by \\(y=-6.64x + 0.05x^2\\) occurs at \\(x=\\frac{6.64}{2(0.05)}\\approx 66\\). So the model estimates that SAT score decreases in a quadratic fashion with respect to fraction taking the test, until that fraction reaches 66 percent of student, then is expected to increase.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes(x=frac, y=sat)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do see some possible quadratic trend, but we should be really careful about extrapolation.

This happens because now we are only comparing states in the same region of the country. The p-value associated with teacher salary is now testing the null hypothesis “There is no relationship between average teacher salary and SAT score among states in the same region of the country, with the same percentage of students taking the test, and same student to teacher ratio.”\nBecause we only have 50 states to begin with, breaking down by region results in small sample sizes, which contributes to the large p-values. Furthermore, it is unclear why we would need to account for region here. If our goal is to assess the impact of educational spending on SAT scores, it is probably okay to compare states in different regions of the country. Unless we have some reason for wanting to compare states in the same region, we shouldn’t include region as an explanatory variable (even though including it did raise our \\(R^2\\) value above 0.9). In general, we should only include variables if they help us address our research question. In this case, it’s not clear that accounting for region helps us better understand the relationship between a state’s investment in education, and its students average SAT scores.\nIt is important to note that we should not decide whether to include a variable based on whether or not it yielded a small p-value. Adding or deleting variables from a model until we get a desired p-value on a variable we’re interested in can lead to Confirmation bias (that is choosing our model in a way that intentionally confirms what we expected or hoped to be true), and to detecting spurious correlations that will not be replicable in future studies. This phenomenon, known as p-hacking has led to incorrect and unethical conclusions. We should make modeling decisions about which variables to include in a model before looking at the p-values and then draw conclusions based on the results we see, keeping in mind that p-values are only a part of the picture.\nPredictions and Intervals\nGoing back to Model M5, which did not include region, we can make confidence and predictions intervals corresponding to hypothetical states.\n\nnewstate &lt;- data.frame(salary = 45, frac=0.5, ratio=15)\n\n\npredict(SAT_M5, newdata = newstate, interval=\"confidence\", conf.level=0.95)\n\n       fit     lwr    upr\n1 1116.615 1085.93 1147.3\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that the average of average SAT scores among all states with average teacher salary of 45 thousand dollars, where 50% of students take the SAT and having student-to-teacher ratio of 15 is between 1085 and 1147.\n\npredict(SAT_M5, newdata = newstate, interval=\"prediction\", conf.level=0.95)\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 1116.615 1055.256 1177.973\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that an individual state with average teacher salary of 45 thousand dollars, where 50% of students take the SAT and having student-to-teacher ratio of 15 will have an average SAT score between 1055 and 1178.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Modeling Car Price\nWe’ll build a model for the price of a new 2015 car, to help us understand what factors are related to the price of a car.\n\ndata(Cars2015)\nCars2015 &lt;- Cars2015 %&gt;% rename(Price=LowPrice)\nCars2015 &lt;- Cars2015%&gt;% select(-HighPrice)\nglimpse(Cars2015)\n\nRows: 110\nColumns: 19\n$ Make      &lt;fct&gt;

Notice the very large standard errors associated with both regression coefficients, which lead to very wide confidence intervals.\nIn fact, if two variables are perfectly correlated, it will be impossible to fit them both in a model, and you will get an error message.\nImpact on Prediction\nSuppose we want to predict the price of a car that can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 9.5 seconds, and completes a quarter mile in 17.3 seconds.\n\nexp(predict(Cars_M1, newdata = data.frame(Acc060=9.5, QtrMile=17.3)))\n\n       1 \n20.92084 \n\n\n\nexp(predict(Cars_M2, newdata = data.frame(Acc060=9.5, QtrMile=17.3)))\n\n       1 \n21.18223 \n\n\n\nexp(predict(Cars_M3, newdata = data.frame(Acc060=9.5, QtrMile=17.3)))\n\n       1 \n21.05489 \n\n\nThe predicted values are similar.

    "text": "6.1 Logistic Regression\n\n6.1.1 Modeling Binary Response\nSo far, we have modeled only quantitative response variables. The normal error regression model makes the assumption that the response variable is normally distributed, given the value(s) of the explanatory variables.\nNow, we’ll look at how to model a categorical response variable. We’ll consider only situations where the response is binary (i.e. has 2 categories). Problems with categorical response variables are sometimes called classification problems, while problems with numeric response variables are sometimes called regression problems.\n\n\n6.1.2 Credit Card Dataset\nWe’ll work with a dataset pertaining to 10,000 credit cards. The goal is to predict whether or not the user will default on the payment, using information on the credit card balance, user’s annual income, and whether or not the user is a student. Data come from Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani.\n\nlibrary(ISLR)\ndata(Default)\nsummary(Default)\n\n default    student       balance           income     \n No :9667   No :7056   Min.   :   0.0   Min.   :  772  \n Yes: 333   Yes:2944   1st Qu.: 481.7   1st Qu.:21340  \n                       Median : 823.6   Median :34553  \n                       Mean   : 835.4   Mean   :33517  \n                       3rd Qu.:1166.3   3rd Qu.:43808  \n                       Max.   :2654.3   Max.   :73554  \n\n\nDefault and Balance\nThe plot displays each person’s credit card balance on the x-axis, and whether or not they defaulted (a 0 or 1) on the y-axis.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x=balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that defaults are rare when the balance is less than $1,000, and more common for balances above $2,000.\nWe’ll first try fitting a linear regression model to the data to try to estimate the probability of a person defaulting on a loan, using the size of their balance as the explanatory variable.\n\n#convert default from yes/no to 0/1\nDefault$default &lt;- as.numeric(Default$default==\"Yes\") \n\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2)  + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of problems with this model!\nIt allows the estimated probability of of default to be negative. It also assumes a linear trend that doesn’t seem to fit the data very well.\nA sigmoidal curve, like the one below, seems like a better model for default probabilities. This curve stays between 0 and 1, and its curved nature seems like a better fit for the data.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Logistic Regression Model\nA logistic regression model uses a sigmoidal curve like the one we saw to model default probabilities, using balance as an explanatory variable.\nThe model makes use of the function\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+x^x}, \\]\nwhose graph is shown below. This function is called an inverse logit function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with our linear model \\(E(Y_i) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\), we need to transform \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\) into the interval (0,1).\n\nLet \\(\\pi_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} }}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}}}\\).\nThen \\(0 \\leq \\pi_i \\leq 1\\), and \\(\\pi_i\\) represents an estimate of \\(P(Y_i=1)\\).\nThis function maps the values of \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\) into the interval (0,1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logistic regression model assumes that:\n\n\n\\(Y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\)\n\n\\(E(Y_i) = P(Y_i=1) = \\pi_i=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}}}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}}}\\) i.e. \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}= \\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right).\\) (This is called the logit function and can be written \\(\\text{logit}(\\pi_i)\\).\n\nInstead of assuming that the expected response is a linear function of the explanatory variables, we are assuming that it is a function of a linear function of the explanatory variables.\nWe fit the logistic curve to the credit card data.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fit the logistic regression model in R, we use the function glm, instead of lm. The function is specified the same way as before, and we add family = binomial(link = \"logit\").\n\nCCDefault_M &lt;- glm(data=Default, default ~ balance, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\nsummary(CCDefault_M)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = default ~ balance, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), \n    data = Default)\n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate  Std.

Least squares does not work well in this generalized setting. Instead, the b’s are calculated using a more advanced technique, known as maximum likelihood estimation. We won’t say anything more about that topic here, but it is a prominent technique, widely used in statistic modeling. It is explored in more detail in advanced statistics courses, such as STAT 445:Mathematical Statistics.",

The odds of a fair coin landing heads are \\(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}=1\\), sometimes written 1:1.\n\nThe odds of a fair 6-sided die landing on a 1 are \\(\\frac{1/6}{1-1/6}=\\frac{1}{5}\\), sometimes written 1:5.\n\nIn the credit card example, the odds of default are:\n\nFor a $1,000 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.005752145}{1-0.005752145} \\approx 1:173.\\)\nFor a $1,500 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.08294762 }{1-0.08294762 } \\approx 1:11.\\)\nFor a $2,000 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.5857694}{1-0.5857694} \\approx 1.414:1.\\)\n\nThe quantity \\(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}}{\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}}\\) is called the odds ratio and represents the odds ratio of a default for user \\(i\\), compared to user \\(j\\).\nExample:\nThe default odds ratio for a $1,000 payment, compared to a $2,000 payment is\nThe odds ratio is \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{173}}{\\frac{1.414}{1}}\\approx 1:244.\\)\nThe odds of a default are about 244 times larger for a $2,000 payment than a $1,000 payment.\n\n\n6.2.2 Interpretation of \\(\\beta_1\\)\nConsider the odds ratio for a case \\(j\\) with explanatory variable \\(x + 1\\), compared to case \\(i\\) with explanatory variable \\(x\\).\nThat is \\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\), and \\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1(x+1)\\).\n\\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}}{\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}}\\right)=\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}\\right)-\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1(x+1)-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1(x))=\\beta_1.\\)\nFor every 1-unit increase in \\(x\\) we expect the log odds of “success” to multiply by a factor of \\(\\beta_1\\).\nFor every 1-unit increase in \\(x\\) we expect the odds of “success” to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\).\nInterpretation in Credit Card Example\n\\(b_1=0.0055\\)\nFor each 1-dollar increase in balance on the credit card., the odds of default are estimated to multiply by \\(e^{0.0055}\\approx1.0055\\).\nThat is, for each additional dollar on the card balance, the odds of default are estimated to increase by 0.55%\nFor each increase of \\(d\\) dollars in credit card balance, odds of default are estimated to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{0.0055d}\\).\nFor every $1,000 increase in balance, the odds of default are expected to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{0.0055\\times 1000}\\approx 244\\).\nThus, the odds of default for a balance of $2,000 are estimated to be \\(e^{0.0055\\times 1000}\\approx 244\\) times as great as the odds of default for a $1,000 balance. This matches our result when we actually calculated out the probabilities and odds.\nHypothesis test for \\(\\beta_1=0\\)\nThe p-value on the “balance” line of the regression output is associated with the null hypothesis \\(\\beta_1=0\\), that is that there is no relationship between balance and the odds of defaulting on the payment.\nThe fact that the p-value is so small tells us that there is strong evidence of a relationship between balance and odds of default.\nConfidence Intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\)\n\nconfint(CCDefault_M, level = 0.95)\n\n                    2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept) -11.383288936 -9.966565064\nbalance       0.005078926  0.005943365\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that for each 1 dollar increase in credit card balance, the odds of default are expected to multiply by a factor between \\(e^{0.00508}\\approx 1.0051\\) and \\(e^{0.00594}\\approx 1.0060\\).\nThis is a profile-likelihood interval, which you can read more about here.",

    "text": "7.1 Modeling for Prediction\n\n7.1.1 Overview\nWe’ve previously learned how to build models for the purpose of interpretation, when our primary focus is on understanding relationships between variables in the model. In this chapter, we’ll examine how to build models for situations when we are not interested in understanding relationships between variables, and instead care only about making the most accurate predictions possible.\nWe’ve seen that when we model for interpretation, we encounter a tradeoff between model complexity and interpretability. We wanted to choose a model that is complex enough to reasonably approximate the structure of the underlying data, but at the same time, not so complicated that it becomes hard to interpret. When modeling for prediction, we don’t need to worry about interpretability, which can sometimes make more complex models more desirable. Nevertheless, we’ll encounter a different kind of tradeoff, involving model complexity, that we’ll have to think about, and we’ll see that more complex models do not always lead to better predictions.\nPredictive Modeling Vocabulary\n\nThe new data on which we make predictions is called test data.\nThe data used to fit the model is called training data.\n\nIn the training data, we know the values of the explanatory and response variables. In the test data, we know only the values of the explanatory variables and want to predict the values of the response variable.\n\n\n7.1.2 Illustration of Predictive Modeling\nThe illustration shows observations from a simulated dataset consisting of 100 observations of a single explanatory variable \\(x\\), and response variable \\(y\\). We want to find a model that captures the trend in the data and will be best able to predict new values of y, for given x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll fit several different polynomial models to the data, increasing in complexity from the most simple model we could possibly use, a constant model, to a very complex eighth degree polynomial model.\nConstant Model to Sample Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Model to Sample Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree 3, 4, and 8 Models\nWe continue exploring higher order polynomial models. The blue curve represents a third degree (cubic) polynomial model, while the red curve represents a fourth degree (quartic) model and the green represents an eighth degree model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the flexibility of the model increases as we add higher-order terms. The curve is allowed to have more twists and bends. For higher-order, more complex models, individual points have more influence on the shape of the curve. This can be both a good and bad thing, as it allows the model to better bend and fit the data, but also makes it susceptible to the influence of outliers.\n\n\n7.1.3 Predicting New Data\nNow, suppose we have a new dataset of 100, x-values, and want to predict \\(y\\).

It is possible to start modeling noise, rather than true signal in the training data, which hurts the accuracy of the model when applied to new data.\n\n\n7.1.6 Graph of RMSPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining error decreases as model becomes more complex\n\nTesting error is lowest for the 3rd degree model, then starts to increase again\n\n\n\n7.1.7 Best Model\nOf the models we looked at, the third degree model does the best.

    "text": "7.2 Variance-Bias Tradeoff\n\n7.2.1 What Contributes to Prediction Error?\nSuppose \\(Y_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nLet \\(\\hat{f}\\) represent the function of our explanatory variable(s) \\(x^*\\) used to predict the value of response variable \\(y^*\\). Thus \\(\\hat{y}^* = f(x^*)\\).\nThere are three factors that contribute to the expected value of \\(\\left(y^* - \\hat{y}\\right)^2 = \\left(y^* - \\hat{f}(x^*)\\right)^2\\).\n\nBias associated with fitting model: Model bias pertains to the difference between the true response function value \\(f(x^*)\\), and the average value of \\(\\hat{f}(x^*)\\) that would be obtained in the long run over many samples.\n\n\nfor example, if the true response function \\(f\\) is cubic, then using a constant, linear, or quadratic model would result in biased predictions for most values of \\(x^*\\).\n\nVariance associated with fitting model: Individual observations in the training data are subject to random sampling variability. The more flexible a model is, the more weight is put on each individual observation increasing the variance associated with the model.\nVariability associated with prediction: Even if we knew the true value \\(f(x^*)\\), which represents the expected value of \\(y^*\\) given \\(x=x^*\\), the actual value of \\(y^*\\) will vary due to random noise (i.e. the \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\) term).\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Variance and Bias\nThe third source of variability cannot be controlled or eliminated. The first two, however are things we can control. If we could figure out how to minimize bias while also minimizing variance associated with a prediction, that would be great! But…\nThe constant model suffers from high bias. Since it does not include a linear, quadratic, or cubic term, it cannot accurately approximate the true regression function.\nThe Eighth degree model suffers from high variance. Although it could, in theory, approximate the true regression function correctly, it is too flexible, and is thrown off because of the influence of individual points with high degrees of variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Variance-Bias Tradeoff\nAs model complexity (flexibility) increases, bias decreases. Variance, however, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, it can be shown that:\n\\(\\text{Expected RMSPE} = \\text{Variance} + \\text{Bias}^2\\)\nOur goal is the find the “sweetspot” where expected RMSPE is minimized.\n\n\n7.2.4 Modeling for Prediction\n\nWhen our purpose is purely prediction, we don’t need to worry about keeping the model simple enough to interpret.\n\nGoal is to fit data well enough to make good predictions on new data without modeling random noise in the training (overfitting)\n\nA model that is too simple suffers from high bias\n\nA model that is too complex suffers from high variance and is prone to overfitting\n\nThe right balance is different for every dataset\n\nMeasuring error on data used to fit the model (training data) does not accurately predict how well model will be able to predict new data (test data)\n\n\n\n7.2.5 Cross-Validation\nWe’ve seen that training error is not an accurate approximation of test error. Instead, we’ll approximate test error, by setting aside a set of the training data, and using it as if it were a test set. This process is called cross-validation, and the set we put aside is called the validation set.\n\nPartition data into disjoint sets (folds). Approximately 5 folds recommended.\n\nBuild a model using 4 of the 5 folds.\n\nUse model to predict responses for remaining fold.\nCalculate root mean square error \\(RMSPE=\\displaystyle\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum((\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2)}{n'}}\\).\n\nRepeat for each of 5 folds.\n\nAverage RMSPE values across folds.\n\nIf computational resources permit, it is often beneficial to perform CV multiple times, using different sets of folds.\n\n\n7.2.6 Cross-Validation Illustration\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-schematic-illustration-of-K-fold-cross-validation-for-K-5-Original-dataset-shown_fig5_311668395\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.7 CV in R\nThe train function in the caret R package performs cross validation automatically. We’ll use it to compare five different models for house prices among a dataset of 1,000 houses sold in Ames, IA between 2006 and 2010.\nWe’ll consider six different models of (mostly) increasing complexity.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nTrain_Data &lt;- read_csv(\"Ames_Train_Data.csv\")  # Load data\nlibrary(caret)   # load caret package\n\n\n# set cross-validation settings - use 10 repeats of 10-fold CV\ncontrol &lt;- trainControl(method=\"repeatedcv\", number=10, repeats=10, savePredictions = \"all\" )\n\n# define models\n# set same random seed before each model to ensure same partitions are used in CV, making them comparable\n\nset.seed(10302023)   \nmodel1 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, \n                SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` ,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel2 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, \n                SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` +  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel3 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` + \n                  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area` + \n                  `Neighborhood` + `Bldg Type`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel4 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` \n                + `Gr Liv Area`  + `Garage Area` \n                + `Neighborhood` + `Bldg Type` + `Year Built`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel5 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` + \n                  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area` + `Neighborhood` + \n                  `Bldg Type` + `Year Built` + I(`Overall Qual`^2) + \n                  I(`Gr Liv Area`^2) + I(`Garage Area`^2) + \n                  I(`Year Built`^2),  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel6 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)  # include everything linearly\n\n\n# Calculate RMSPE for each model\nRMSPE1 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model1$pred$obs-model1$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE2 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model2$pred$obs-model2$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE3 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model3$pred$obs-model3$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE4 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model4$pred$obs-model4$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE5 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model5$pred$obs-model5$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE6 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model6$pred$obs-model6$pred$pred)^2))\n\n\nRMSPE1\n\n[1] 51710.58\n\nRMSPE2\n\n[1] 44192.34\n\nRMSPE3\n\n[1] 38212.96\n\nRMSPE4\n\n[1] 38016.67\n\nRMSPE5\n\n[1] 38245.46\n\nRMSPE6\n\n[1] 40586.14\n\n\nWe see that in this case, model M4 performed the best on the hold-out data.

    "text": "7.3 Ridge Regression\n\n7.3.1 Complexity in Model Coefficients\nWe’ve thought about complexity in terms of the number of terms we include in a model, as well as whether we include quadratic terms and higher order terms and interactions. We can also think about model complexity in terms of the coefficients \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\). Larger values of \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are associated with more complex models. Smaller values of \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are associated with less complex models. When \\(b_j=0\\), this mean variable \\(j\\) is not used in the model.\nTo illustrate, we fit a regression model to the Ames housing dataset, which includes 71 possible explanatory variables, in addition to price.\n\nset.seed(10302021)\nsamp &lt;- sample(1:nrow(ames_raw), 1000)\nTrain_Data &lt;- ames_raw[samp,]\n\nThe full list of coefficient estimates is shown below.\n\nM_OLS &lt;-

in the model were 0, then we would be using the most simple constant model, and the prediction for the price of each house would be exactly the same as the overall mean. As \\(b_j's\\) get farther from 0, predictions begin move away from the overall mean and depend more and more on the values or categories of the explanatory variable(s) associated with individual houses. This creates a risk, however, of overfitting.\nA way to combat this, other than dropping variables from the model, is to shrink some or all of the regression coefficients closer to 0, pushing predictions closer to the overall mean.\nA statistical technique for doing this is called ridge regression.\n\n\n7.3.2 Ridge Regression Penalty\nWe’ve seen that in ordinary least-squares regression, \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are chosen in a way that to minimizes\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}i)^2 =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x{i1} + b_2{x_i2} + \\ldots +b_px\\_{ip}))^2\n\\]\nWhen \\(p\\) is large and we want to be careful of overfitting, a common approach is to add a “penalty term” to this function, to incentive choosing values of \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) that are closer to 0, thereby “shrinking” the predictions toward the overall mean house price.\nSpecifically, we minimize:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\\\\ =  & \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is a pre-determined positive constant.\nLarger values of \\(b_j\\) typically help the model better fit the training data, thereby making the first term smaller, but also make the second term larger. The idea is the find optimal values of \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) that are large enough to allow the model to fit the data well, thus keeping the first term (SSR) small, while also keeping the penalty term small as well.\n\n\n7.3.3 Choosing \\(\\lambda\\)\nThe value of \\(\\lambda\\) is predetermined by the user. The larger the value of \\(\\lambda\\), the more heavily large \\(b_j's\\) are penalized. A value of \\(\\lambda=0\\) corresponds to ordinary least-squares.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ=& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\\\\ =  & \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSmall values of \\(\\lambda\\) lead to more complex models, with larger \\(|b_j|\\)’s.\n\nAs \\(\\lambda\\) increases, \\(|b_j|\\)’s shrink toward 0. The model becomes less complex, thus bias increases, but variance decreases.\n\nWe can use cross validation to determine the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using ridge regression, it is important to standardize each explanatory variable (i.e. subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation). This ensures each variable has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Without standardizing the optimal choice of \\(b_j\\)’s would depend on scale, with variables with larger absolute measurements having more influence. We’ll standardize the response variable too. Though this is not strictly necessary, it doesn’t hurt. We can always transform back if necessary.\nStandardization is performed using the scale command in R.\n\nTrain_sc &lt;- Train_Data %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, scale)\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Ridge Regression on Housing Dataset\nWe’ll use the caret package to perform cross validation in order to find the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\). To use ridge regression, we specify method = \"glmnet\", and tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=0, lambda=l_vals). Note the alpha value can be changed to use other types of penalized regression sometimes used in predictive modeling, such as lasso or elastic net.\n\ncontrol = trainControl(\"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats=10)\nl_vals = 10^seq(-3, 3, length = 100)  # test values between 1/1000 and 1000\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_ridge &lt;- train(SalePrice ~ .,\n                       data = Train_sc, method = \"glmnet\", trControl=control , \n                      tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=0, lambda=l_vals))\n\nValue of \\(\\lambda\\) minimizing RMSPE:\n\nHousing_ridge$bestTune$lambda\n\n[1] 0.6135907\n\n\nWe examine RMSPE on the withheld data as a function of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing \\(\\lambda\\) = 0.6135907, obtain the following set of ridge regression coefficients.

    "text": "7.4 Decision Trees\n\n7.4.1 Basics of Decision Trees\nA decision tree is a flexible alternative to a regression model. It is said to be nonparametric because it does not involve parameters like \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots \\beta_p\\). A tree makes no assumption about the nature of the relationship between the response and explanatory variables, and instead allows us to learn this relationship from the data. A tree makes prediction by repeatedly grouping together like observations in the training data. We can make predictions for a new case, by tracing it through the tree, and averaging responses of training cases in the same terminal node.\nDecision Tree Example:\nWe fit a decision tree to the Ames Housing dataset, using the rpart function in a package by the same name.\n\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\ntree &lt;- rpart(SalePrice~., data=Train_Data, cp=0.04)\nrpart.plot(tree, box.palette=\"RdBu\", shadow.col=\"gray\", nn=TRUE, cex=1, extra=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the houses are first split based on whether or not their overall quality rating was less than 8. Each of the resulting nodes are then split again, using information from other explanatory variables. Each split partitions the data further, so that houses in the same node can be thought of as being similar to one another.\n\nThe predicted price of a House with overall quality 7, and was built in 1995 is $200,000.\nThe predicted price of a House overall quality 8 and 1,750 sq. ft. on the first floor is $370,000.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Partitioning in A Decision Tree\nFor a quantitative response variable, data are split into two nodes so that responses in the same node are as similar as possible, while responses in the different nodes are as different as possible.\nLet L and R represent the left and right nodes from a possible split. Let \\(n_L\\) and \\(n_R\\) represent the number of observations in each node, and \\(\\bar{y}_L\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_R\\) represent the mean of the training data responses in each node.\nFor each possible split, involving an explanatory variable, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\n\\]\nWe choose the split that minimizes this quantity.\nPartitioning Example\nConsider a dataset with two explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), and a response variable \\(y\\), whose values are shown numerically in the graph.\n\n\n   [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14]\nx1    8    2    8    1    8    6    2    5    1     8     4    10     9     8\nx2    5    3    1    1    4    3    8    1   10     8     6     5     0     2\ny   253   64  258   21  257  203  246  114  331   256   213   406   326   273\n   [,15]\nx1     6\nx2     1\ny    155\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to split up the data, using information about \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in a way that makes the \\(y\\) values grouped together as similar as possible.\n1. One Possible Split (\\(x_1 &lt; 5.5\\))\nWe could split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_1 &lt; 5.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calcuate the mean y-value in each resulting node:\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+21+64+114)/6 \\approx 164.84\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (203+155+256+253+257+273+258+326+406)/9 \\approx 265.22\\)\n\nTo measure measure the amount of deviation in the node, we calculate the sum of the squared difference between each individual value and the overall mean in each node.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-164.83)^2+(246-164.33)^2 + \\ldots+(114-164.33)^2 \\\\\n& =69958.83\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(203-265.22)^2+(155-265.22)^2 + \\ldots+(406-265.22)^2 \\\\\n& =39947.56\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAdding together these two quantities, we obtain an overall measure of the squared deviations between observations in the same node.\n\n69958.83 + 39947.56 = 109906.4\n\n2.Second Possible Split (\\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\))\nWe could alternatively split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this split,\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+21+64+114 + 203+155)/8 \\approx 168.375\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (256+253+257+273+258+326+406)/7 \\approx 289.857\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-168.375)^2+(246-168.375)^2 + \\ldots+(203-168.375)^2 \\\\\n& =71411.88\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(203-289.857)^2+(155-289.857)^2 + \\ldots+(406-289.857)^2 \\\\\n& =19678.86\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe total squared deviation is:\n\n71411.88 + 19678.86 = 91090.74\n\nThe split at \\(x1 &lt; 6.5\\) is better than \\(x_1&lt;5.5\\)\n3. Third Possible Split (\\(x_2 &lt; 5.5\\))\nWe could also split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_2 &lt; 5.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this split,\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+256)/4 \\approx 261.5\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (21 + 64 + \\ldots + 406)/11 \\approx 211.82\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-261.5)^2+(246-261.5)^2 + (213-261.5)^2+(256-261.5)^2 \\\\\n& =7453\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(21-211.82)^2+(64-211.82)^2 + \\ldots+(406-211.82)^2 \\\\\n& =131493.6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe sum of squared deviations is:\n\n7453 + 131493.6 = 138946.6\n\nComparison of Splits\n\nOf the three split’s we’ve calculated, \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\\) is minimized using \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\nIn fact, if we calculate all possible splits over \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\\) is minimized by splitting on \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\)\n\nThus, we perform the first split in the tree, using \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Next Splits\nNext, we find the best splits on the resulting two nodes. It turns out that the left node is best split on \\(x_2 &lt; 4.5\\), and the right node is best split on \\(x_1 &lt; 8.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Recursive Partitioning\nSplitting continues until nodes reach a certain predetermined minimal size, or until change improvement in model fit drops below a predetermined value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.5 Model Complexity in Trees\nThe more we partition data into smaller nodes, the more complex the model becomes. As we continue to partition, bias decreases, as cases are grouped with those that are more similar to themselves. On the other hand, variance increases, as there are fewer cases in each node to be averaged, putting more weight on each individual observation.\nSplitting into too small of nodes can lead to drastic overfitting. In the extreme case, if we split all the way to nodes of size 1, we would get RMSE of 0 on the training data, but should certainly not expect RMSPE of 0 on the test data.\nThe optimal depth of the tree, or minimal size for terminal nodes can be determined using cross-validation. The rpart package uses a complexity parameter cp, which determines how much a split must improve model fit in order to be made. Smaller values of cp are associated with more complex tree models, since they allow splits even when model fit only improves by a little.\n\n\n7.4.6 Cross-Validation on Housing Data\nWe’ll use caret to determine the optimal value of the cp parameter. We use method=\"rpart\" to grow decision trees.\n\ncp_vals = 10^seq(-8, 1, length = 100) # test values between 1/10^8 and 1\ncolnames(Train_sc) &lt;- make.names(colnames(Train_sc))\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_Tree &lt;- train(data=Train_sc, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"rpart\", trControl=control, \n                     tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=cp_vals))\n\nThe optimal value of cp is:\n\nHousing_Tree$bestTune\n\n             cp\n52 0.0004328761\n\n\nWe plot RMSPE on the holdout data as a function of cp.\n\ncp &lt;- Housing_Tree$results$cp\nRMSPE &lt;- Housing_Tree$results$RMSE\nggplot(data=data.frame(cp, RMSPE), aes(x=cp, y=RMSPE))+geom_line() + xlim(c(0,0.001)) + ylim(c(0.475,0.485))  + \n  ggtitle(\"Regression Tree Cross Validation Results\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.7 Comparing OLS, Lasso, Ridge, and Tree\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_OLS &lt;- train(data=Train_sc, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_lasso &lt;- train(SalePrice ~., data = Train_sc, method = \"glmnet\", trControl=control, \n                      tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=1, lambda=l_vals))\n\nRMSPE on the standardized version of the response variable is displayed below for ordinary least squares, ridge regression, lasso regression, and a decision tree.\n\nmin(Housing_OLS $results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.5634392\n\nmin(Housing_ridge$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.4570054\n\nmin(Housing_lasso$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.4730672\n\nmin(Housing_Tree$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.477414\n\n\nIn this situation, the tree outperforms OLS, but does not do as well as lasso or ridge. The best model will vary depending on the nature of the data. We can use cross-validation to determine which model is likely to perform best in prediction.\n\n\n7.4.8 Random Forest\nA popular extension of a decision tree is a random forest. A random forest consists of many (often ~10,000) trees. Predictions are made by averaging predictions from individual trees.\n\nIn order to ensure the trees are different from each other:\n\neach tree is grown from a different bootstrap sample of the training data.\n\nwhen deciding on a split, only a random subset of explanatory variables are considered.\n\n\nGrowing deep trees ensures low bias. In a random forest, averaging across many deep trees decreases variance, while maintaining low bias.",

On the other hand, the tree estimates only a 0.16 probability of the second person defaulting, compared to 0.26 for the logistic regression model.\n\n\n7.7.3 Assessing Classifier Accuracy\nWe’ve seen \\(\\text{RMSPE} = \\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}}\\) used as a measure of predictive accuracy in a regression problem.\nSince our outcome is not numeric, this is not a good measure of predictive accuracy in a classification problem. We’ll examine some alternatives we can use instead.\nClassification Accuracy\nOne simple approach is calculate the proportion of credit card users classified correctly. If a person has model estimates a predicted probability of default greater than 0.5, the person is predicted to default, while if the probability estimate is less than 0.5, the person is predicted to not default.\nThe table shows the prediction for each of the 10 users, using both logistic regression and the decision tree.\n\nLR_Pred &lt;- factor(ifelse(LR_Prob &gt; 0.5, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\nTree_Pred &lt;- factor(ifelse(Tree_Prob &gt; 0.5, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\nLR_Res_df &lt;- data.frame(student, balance, LR_Prob, Tree_Prob, LR_Pred,Tree_Pred, Actual_Default)\nkable(head(LR_Res_df, 50)%&gt;% arrange(desc(LR_Prob)) %&gt;% head(10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudent\nbalance\nLR_Prob\nTree_Prob\nLR_Pred\nTree_Pred\nActual_Default\n\n\n\n\n2465\nYes\n2026.864\n0.54\n0.77\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\n1228\nNo\n1682.201\n0.26\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6656\nNo\n1551.028\n0.14\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n1185\nNo\n1541.813\n0.13\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9963\nYes\n1635.175\n0.12\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6635\nNo\n1434.128\n0.07\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n9691\nNo\n1391.318\n0.06\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5921\nYes\n1513.542\n0.06\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9755\nNo\n1233.619\n0.02\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7569\nYes\n1294.286\n0.02\n0.02\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that although the probabilities differ, the logistic regression model and classification tree give the same predictions for these ten cases. Both correctly predict 8 out of the 10 cases, but mistakenly predict the first person to default, when they didn’t, and mistakenly predict that the sixth person would not default when they did.\nWe’ll check the classification accuracy for the model and the tree.\n\nbase::sum(LR_Pred == Actual_Default)/1000\n\n[1] 0.972\n\n\n\nbase::sum(Tree_Pred == Actual_Default)/1000\n\n[1] 0.97\n\n\nWe see that the two techniques are each right approximately 97% of the time.\nThis may not really be as good as it sounds. Can you think of a very simple classification strategy that would achieve a similarly impressive predictive accuracy on these data?\n\n\n7.7.4 Confusion Matrix\nIn addition to assessing overall accuracy, it is sometimes helpful to assess how well models are able to predict outcomes in each class. For example, how accurately can a model detect people who do actually default on their payments?\nA confusion matrix is a two-by-two table displaying the number of cases predicted in each category as columns, and the number of cases actually in each category as rows\n\n\n\n\nActually Negative\nActually Positive\n\n\n\n\nPredicted Negative\n# True Negative\n# False Negative\n\n\nPredicted Positive\n# False Positive\n# True Positive\n\n\n\nThe confusionMatrix matrix command in R returns the confusion matrix for all 1,000 test cases.\nLet’s look at the confusion matrix for all 1,000 test cases. The data argument is the predicted outcome, and the reference argument is the true outcome. The positive argument is the category that we’ll classify as a positive.\nLogistic Regression Confusion Matrix\n\nconfusionMatrix(data=LR_Pred, reference=factor(Actual_Default) , positive=\"Yes\")\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  No Yes\n       No  957  20\n       Yes   8  15\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.972           \n                 95% CI : (0.9598, 0.9813)\n    No Information Rate : 0.965           \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.12988         \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.5035          \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.03764         \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.4286          \n            Specificity : 0.9917          \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.6522          \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.9795          \n             Prevalence : 0.0350          \n         Detection Rate : 0.0150          \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.0230          \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.7101          \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : Yes             \n                                          \n\n\nOut of 965 people who did not default, the logistic regression model correctly predicted 957 of them.\nOut of 35 people that did default, the model correctly predicted 15 of them.\nTree Confusion Matrix\n\n# data is predicted class\n# reference is actual class\nconfusionMatrix( data = Tree_Pred , reference= Actual_Default, \"Yes\")\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  No Yes\n       No  954  19\n       Yes  11  16\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.97            \n                 95% CI : (0.9574, 0.9797)\n    No Information Rate : 0.965           \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.2225          \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.5009          \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.2012          \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.4571          \n            Specificity : 0.9886          \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.5926          \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.9805          \n             Prevalence : 0.0350          \n         Detection Rate : 0.0160          \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.0270          \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.7229          \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : Yes             \n                                          \n\n\nOut of 965 people who did not default, the logistic regression model correctly predicted 960 of them.\nOut of 35 people that did default, the model correctly predicted 11 of them.\nNotice that the tree was less likely to predict a person to default in general, returning only 16 positive predictions, compared to 23 for the logistic regression model.\n\n\n7.7.5 Sensitivity and Specificity\nThe sensitivity of a classifier is the proportion of all positive cases that the model correctly identifies as positive. (i.e. probability model says “positive” given actually is positive.)\n\\[\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive} + \\text{False Negative}} = \\frac{\\text{Correctly Predicted Positives}}{\\text{Total Number of Actual Positives}}\n\\]\nLR Sensitivity\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{15+20} \\approx 0.4286\n\\]\nTree Sensitivity\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{11+24} \\approx 0.3143\n\\]\nThe specificity of a classifier is the proportion of all negative cases that the model correctly identifies as negative (i.e probabiltiy model says “negative” given truly is negative.)\n\\[\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{True Negative}}{\\text{True Negative} + \\text{False Positive}}= \\frac{\\text{Correctly Predicted Negatives}}{\\text{Total Number of Actual Negatives}}\n\\]\nLR Specificity\n\\[\\frac{957}{957+8} \\approx 0.9917\\]\nTree Specificity\n\\[\\frac{960}{960+5} \\approx 0.9948 \\]\nIn a given situation, we should think about the cost of a false negative vs a false positive when determining whether to place more weight on sensitivity or specificity. For example, “is it worse to tell a patient they tested positive for a disease when they really don’t have it, or to not tell them they tested positive when they really do have it?”",

    "text": "7.8 Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\n\n7.8.1 Separating +’s and -’s\nThe prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures, seen in the previous section are based only on the predicted outcome, without considering the probability estimates themselves. These techniques treat a 0.49 estimated probability of default the same as a 0.01 estimated probability.\nWe would hope to see more defaults among people with high estimated default probabilities than low ones. To assess this, we can list the people in order from highest to lowest probability estimates and see where the true defaults lie.\nFor example, consider the following fictional probability estimates produced by two different classifiers (models) for eight credit card users:\nClassifier 1\n\n\n  Classifier1_Probability_Estimate True_Outcome\n1                             0.90          Yes\n2                             0.75          Yes\n3                             0.60           No\n4                             0.40          Yes\n5                             0.30           No\n6                             0.15           No\n7                             0.05           No\n8                             0.01           No\n\n\nClassifier 2\n\n\n  Classifier2_Probability_Estimate True_Outcome\n1                             0.80          Yes\n2                             0.70           No\n3                             0.55           No\n4                             0.40          Yes\n5                             0.35           No\n6                             0.15           No\n7                             0.10          Yes\n8                             0.02           No\n\n\nClassifier 1 is better able to separate the “Yes’s” from “No’s” as the three true “Yes’s” are among the four highest probabilities. Classifier 2 is less able to separate the true “Yes’s” from true “No’s.”\n\n\n7.8.2 ROC Curve\nA receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve tells us how well a predictor is able to separate positive cases from negative cases.\nThe blog (Toward Data Science) [https://towardsdatascience.com/applications-of-different-parts-of-an-roc-curve-b534b1aafb68] writes\n“Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is one of the most common graphical tools to diagnose the ability of a binary classifier, independent of the inherent classification algorithm. The ROC analysis has been used in many fields including medicine, radiology, biometrics, natural hazards forecasting, meteorology, model performance assessment, and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research [1]. If you are a Data Scientist, you might be using it on a daily basis.”\nThe ROC curve plots the true positive (or hit) rate against the false positive rate (false alarm) rate, as the cutoff for a positive classification varies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher the curve, the better the predictor is able to separate positive cases from negative ones.\nPredictions made totally at random would be expected to yield a diagonal ROC curve.\n\n\n7.8.3 Constructing ROC Curve\n\nOrder the probabilities from highest to lowest.\n\nAssume only the case with the highest probability is predicted as a positive.\n\nCalculate the true positive rate (hit rate) \\[\\frac{\\text{\\# True Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Positives}}\\] and false positive (false alarm) \\[\\frac{\\text{\\# False Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Negatives}}\\]rate.\nPlot the point \\[\\left( \\frac{\\text{\\# False Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Negatives}}, \\frac{\\text{\\# True Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Positives}} \\right)\\] in the coordinate plane.\n\nNow assume the cases with the two highest probabilities are predicted as positives, and repeat steps 3-4.\n\nContinue, by classifiying one more case as positive in each step.\n\n\n\n7.8.4 Construct ROC Example\nLet’s practice constructing an ROC curve for a small set of probability estimates.\n\nprob &lt;- c(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.65, 0.45, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05)\nActual &lt;- c(\"+\", \"-\", \"+\", \"+\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"+\", \"-\")\nHit_Rate &lt;- c(\"1/4\", \"1/4\", \"2/4\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\")\nFA_Rate &lt;- c(\"0/6\", \"1/6\", \"1/6\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\")\nkable(data.frame(prob, Actual, Hit_Rate, FA_Rate))\n\n\n\n\nprob\nActual\nHit_Rate\nFA_Rate\n\n\n\n\n0.90\n+\n1/4\n0/6\n\n\n0.80\n-\n1/4\n1/6\n\n\n0.70\n+\n2/4\n1/6\n\n\n0.65\n+\n\n\n\n\n0.45\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.30\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.20\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.15\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.10\n+\n\n\n\n\n0.05\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish filling in the table and sketch a graph of the resulting ROC curve.\nQuestion: If the probability estimate of 0.45 were instead 0.5 or 0.55, would this change the ROC curve? Why or why not?\n\n\n7.8.5 AUC\nThe area under the ROC curve, (AUC) provides a measure of the model’s predictive strength.\nWhile there is no standard for what constitutes a good\" AUC, higher is better, andAUC” is useful for comparing models.\nA model that can perfectly separate successes from failures will have an AUC of 1.\nA model that assigns probabilities at random is expected to have an AUC of 0.5.\n\n\n7.8.6 LR and Tree ROC Curves\n\nlibrary(pROC)\nlibrary(verification)\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default==\"Yes\", pred = LR_Prob)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default==\"Yes\", predictor = LR_Prob)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.8953\n\n\n\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default==\"Yes\", pred = Tree_Prob)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default==\"Yes\", predictor = Tree_Prob)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.75\n\n\n\nRandProb &lt;- runif(1000, 0, 1)\n\n\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default==\"Yes\", pred = RandProb)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default, predictor = RandProb)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.563\n\n\nEven though a model that assigns predictions randomly, with 97% predicted as negatives will have a high accuracy rate, it will yield a poor ROC curve indicating an inability to separate positive cases from negative ones.",

    "text": "7.9 Ethical Considerations in Predictive Modeling\n\n7.9.1 Assumptions in Predictive Models\nLike any other statistical technique, predictive inference (sometimes done through machine learning algorithms) depends on the validity of assumptions.\n\nThe response variable observed in the data is actually the thing we want to predict\n\nTraining/Test data representative of population of interest\nPrediction accuracy is appropriate metric\n\nBelow are some examples of real uses of predictive inference in which some of these assumptions were violated, leading to inappropriate and unethical conclusions.\n\n\n7.9.2 Amazon Hiring Algorithm\nIn 2014, Amazon began working on an algorithm to predict whether a job applicant would be suitable for hire for software developer positions, based on characteristics of their job application.\nresponse variable: rating of candidate’s strength (1-5) explanatory variables: many variables based on information included on the resume (e.g. highest degree, major, GPA, college/university, prior job experiences, internships, frequency of certain words on resume, etc.)\nThe algorithm was trained using data from past applications, rated by humans, over the past 10 years. It could then be used to predict ratings of future job applicants.\nAccording to [Reuters])(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G),\n“In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word “women’s,” as in “women’s chess club captain.” And it downgraded graduates of two all-women’s colleges, according to people familiar with the matter.”\nWhile the algorithm was intended to predict candidate quality, the response variable on the training data actually reflected biases in past hiring decisions, leading the algorithm to do the same.\n\n\n7.9.3 Facial Recognition\nFacial recognition technology is used by law enforcement surveillance, airport passenger screening, and employment and housing decisions. It has, however, been banned for use by police in some cities, including San Francisco and Boston, due to concerns about inequity and privacy.\nResearch has shown that although certain facial recognition algorithms achieve over 90% accuracy overall, accuracy rate is lower among subjects who are female, Black, or 18-30 years old.\nThis is likely due, at least in part, to the algorithms being trained primarily on data an images of people who are not members of these groups.\nAlthough the algorithms might attain strong accuracy overall, it is inappropriate to evaluate them on this basis, without accounting for performance on subgroups in the population.\n\n\n7.9.4 Comments\nThe biases and assumptions noted above are not reasons to abandon predictive modeling, but rather flaws to be aware of and work to correct.\nPredictive algorithms, are only as good as the data on which they are trained and the societies in which they are developed, and will reflect inherent biases. Thus, they should be used cautiously and with with human judgment, just like any other statistical technique.\nBeware of statements like:\n“The data say this!”\n“The algorithm is objective.”\n“The numbers don’t lie.”\nAny data-driven analysis depends on assumptions, and sound judgment and awareness of context are required when assessing the validity of conclusions drawn.\n\n\n7.9.5 Modeling for Prediction\n\nGoal is to make the most accurate predictions possible.\n\nNot concerned with understanding relationships between variables. Not worried model being to complicated to interpret, as long as it yields good predictions.\n\nAim for a model that best captures the signal in the data, without being thrown off by noise.\n\n\nLarge number of predictors is ok\n\nDon’t make model so complicated that it overfits the data.\n\n\nBe sure that model is predicting what you intend it to\n\nReflective of biases inherent in the data on which it was trained",
