The course employs a modern approach, intended to equip students with skills needed for working with today’s complex data. Traditional concepts, like interval estimation and hypothesis testing, are introduced through the lens of multivariate models and simulation. Data computation in R plays a central role throughout the course.\nThe course’s overarching learning outcomes are:\n\nVisualize and wrangle data using statistical software R.\n\nBuild and assess multivariate models to predict future outcomes.\n\nUse statistics from samples to draw inferences about larger populations or processes.\n\nQuantify uncertainty associated with estimates and predictions.\n\nExplain the assumptions associated with statistical models, and evaluate whether these assumptions are reasonably satisfied in context.\n\nWrite reproducible analyses, using statistical software.\n\nMake ethical decisions based on data.\n\nMore specific learning tasks, related to these outcomes are provided in each chapter.\nWho is this course intended for?\nThis course is intended for students who are interested in learning statistical modeling and data computation skills that might prove useful in further courses, research, or career.\nStat 255 can serve as either:\n\na first course in statistics for students with a strong quantitative background, typically including calculus.\na second course in statistics, building on introductory topics taught in courses like Lawrence’s Stat 107: Principles of Statistics or AP Statistics.\n\nAt Lawrence, this course is required for the statistics track of the mathematics major, the economics and mathematics-economics majors, the business analytics track of the business and entrepreneurship major, and the statistics and data science minor. It also satisfies the statistics requirement for several other majors and minors.\nThe prerequisite for the course is either 1) a prior college-level course in statistics (i.e. STAT 107, BIOL 170 or 280, ANTH 207, AP Stats) OR 2) Calculus. (Math 140, AP Calculus, or equivalent).\nThe course does not assume any prior knowledge of statistics, but does move more rapidly than a typical introductory statistics course.

    "section": "4.1 The Normal Error Regression Model",
    "text": "4.1 The Normal Error Regression Model\nYou’ve probably noticed that most of the sampling distributions of statistics we’ve seen were symmetric and bell-shaped in nature. When working with statistics that have symmetric and bell-shaped distributions and know standard error formulas, it is possible to use well-known probability facts to obtain confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests without actually performing simulation.\nIn this chapter, we’ll examine a set of assumptions that, if true, would ensure that statistics like means and differences in means, and regression coefficients follow symmetric and bell-shaped distributions. We’ll learn how to use facts from probability to calculate confidence intervals and p-values without actually performing simulation in these instances.\n\n4.1.1 Example: Ice Cream dispenser\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose an ice cream machine is manufactured to dispense 2 oz. of ice cream per second, on average. If 15 people used the ice cream machine, holding the dispenser for different amounts of time, and each person got exactly 2 oz. per second, the relationship between time holding the dispenser and amount dispensed would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, however, the actual amount dispensed each time it is used will vary due to unknown factors like:\n\nforce applied to dispenser\n\ntemperature\n\nbuild-up of ice cream\n\nother unknown factors\n\nThus, if 15 real people held the dispenser and recorded the amount of ice cream they got, the scatter plot we would see would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the amount of ice cream a person receives as being a result of two separate components, often referred to as signal and noise.\nSignal represents the average amount of ice cream a person is expected to receive based on the amount of time holding the dispenser. In this case, signal is given by the function \\(\\text{Expected Amount} = 2\\times\\text{Time}\\). Everyone who holds the dispenser for \\(t\\) seconds is expected to receive \\(2t\\) ounces of ice cream.\nNoise represents how much each person’s actual amount of ice cream deviates from their expected amount. For example, a person who holds the dispenser for 1.5 seconds and receives 3.58 oz. of ice cream will have received 0.58 ounces more than expected due to noise (i.e. factors beyond time holding the dispenser).\nIn a statistical model, we assume that the response value of a response variable we observe is the sum of the signal, or expected response, which is a function of the explanatory variables in the model, and noise, which results from deviations due to factors beyond those accounted for in the model.\n\n\n4.1.2 Normal Distribution\nIt is common to model noise using a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution, known as a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the error term as a random draw from somewhere in the area below the bell-curve. For example, in the above illustration, most of the area under the curve lies between \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). If this curve represented the noise term in the ice cream example, it would mean that most people’s actual amount of ice cream dispensed would be within \\(\\pm 1\\) ounce of their expected amount (or signal). Notice that the normal distribution is centered at 0, indicating that on average, a person would be expected to get an amount exactly equal to their signal, but that they might deviate above or below this amount by unexplained factors, which can be modeled by random chance.\nA normal distribution is defined by two parameters:\n- \\(\\mu\\) representing the center of the distribution\n- \\(\\sigma\\) representing the standard deviation\nThis distribution is denoted \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the standard deviation is small, such as for the blue curve, noise tends to be close to 0, meaning the observed values will be close to their expectation. On the other hand, the green curve, which has higher standard deviation, would often produce noise values as extreme as \\(\\pm 2\\) or more.\nNote that the square of the standard deviation \\(\\sigma^2\\) is called the variance. Some books denote the normal distribution as \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), instead of \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)\\). We will use the \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) here, which is consistent with R.\n\n\n4.1.3 Modeling Ice Cream Dispenser\nIn this example, we’ll simulate the amount of ice cream dispensed for each person by adding a random number from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5 to the expected amount dispensed, which is given by \\(2x\\), where \\(x\\) represents time pressing the dispenser. We’ll let \\(\\epsilon_i\\) represent the random noise term for the \\(i\\)th person.\nThus, amount dispensed (\\(Y_i\\)) for person \\(i\\) is given by\n\\[\nY_i = 2x_i+\\epsilon_i, \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.5)\n\\]\nIllustration\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount dispensed follows a normal distribution with mean equal to twice the time holding the dispensor and standard deviation 0.5\n\n\n\n\nWe simulate the amount dispensed for a sample of 15 people below. The rnorm(n, \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) function generates \\(n\\) random numbers from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). The code below simulates 15 random numbers and adds them to the expected amount dispensed for 15 people who hold the dispenser for the times shown.\n\nset.seed(10082020)\n# set times \ntime &lt;- c(1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 3.6)\nexpected &lt;- 2*time  # expected amount\nnoise &lt;-rnorm(15, 0, 0.5) %&gt;% round(2)  #generate noise from normal distribution\namount &lt;- 2*time + noise  # calculate observed amounts\nIcecream &lt;- data.frame(time, signal, noise, amount) # set up data table\nkable((Icecream)) #display table\n\n\n\n\ntime\nsignal\nnoise\namount\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n2.0\n0.23\n2.23\n\n\n1.2\n2.4\n-0.49\n1.91\n\n\n1.5\n3.0\n0.58\n3.58\n\n\n1.8\n3.6\n-0.03\n3.57\n\n\n2.1\n4.2\n0.17\n4.37\n\n\n2.1\n4.2\n-0.93\n3.27\n\n\n2.3\n4.6\n0.05\n4.65\n\n\n2.5\n5.0\n-0.37\n4.63\n\n\n2.6\n5.2\n-0.46\n4.74\n\n\n2.8\n5.6\n0.17\n5.77\n\n\n2.9\n5.8\n-0.59\n5.21\n\n\n2.9\n5.8\n0.12\n5.92\n\n\n3.1\n6.2\n0.00\n6.20\n\n\n3.2\n6.4\n0.67\n7.07\n\n\n3.6\n7.2\n0.05\n7.25\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot displays the amount dispensed, compared to the time pressing the dispenser. The red line indicates the line \\(y=2x\\). If there was no random noise, then each person’s amount dispensed would lie exactly on this line.\n\nggplot(data=Icecream1, aes(x=time, y=amount)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Icecream Dispensed\") + xlab(\"Time Pressing dispenser\") + ylab(\"Amount Dispensed\") + geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, color=\"red\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"y=2x\", x= 3.5, y=6.5, size=10, color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nEstimating Regression Line\nIn a real situation, we would not see the signal and noise columns in the table or the red line on the graph. We would only see the time and amount, and points on the scatter plot. From these, we would need to estimate the location of the red line by fitting a least squares regression line to the data, as we’ve done before.\nThe blue line represents the location of the least squares regression line fit to the time and amounts observed.\n\nggplot(data=Icecream1, aes(x=time, y=amount)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Icecream Dispensed\") + xlab(\"Time Pressing dispenser\") + ylab(\"Amount Dispensed\") + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, color=\"red\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"y=2x\", x= 3.5, y=6.5, size=10, color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line is close, but not identical to the red line, representing the true (usually unknown) signal.\nThe slope and intercept of the blue line are given by:\n\nIC_Model &lt;- lm(data=Icecream1, lm(amount~time))\nIC_Model\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lm(amount ~ time), data = Icecream1)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)         time  \n    -0.1299       2.0312  \n\n\nNotice that these estimates are close, but not identical to the intercept and slope of the red line, which are 0 and 2, respectively.\nThe equation of the red line is given by:\n\\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\),\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) represents amount dispensed, and \\(X_i\\) represents time. \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) are the unknown model parameters associated with the ice cream machine’s process.\nUsing the values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) obtained by fitting a model to our observed data as estimates of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), our estimated regression equation is\n\\[\nY_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \\epsilon\\_i = -0.1299087 + 2.0312489X_i + \\epsilon\\_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nAn estimate for \\(\\sigma\\) is given by\n\\(s =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}}\\).\nWe calculate \\(s\\) , using R.\n\ns &lt;- sqrt(sum(IC_Model$residuals^2)/(15-2))\ns\n\n[1] 0.4527185\n\n\nIn statistics it is common to use Greek letters like \\(\\beta_j\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), to represent unknown model parameters, pertaining to a population or process (such as the ice cream dispenser), and English letters like \\(b_j\\) and \\(s\\) to represent statistics calculated from data.\nThe estimates of \\(b_0 = -0.1299087\\), \\(b_1=2.0312489\\), and \\(s = 0.4527185\\) are reasonably close estimates to the values \\(\\beta_0=0, \\beta_1=2\\), and \\(\\sigma = 0.5\\), that we used to generate the data.\nIn a real situation, we’ll have only statistics \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), and \\(s\\), and we’ll need to use them to draw conclusions about parameters \\(\\beta_0=0, \\beta_1=2\\), and \\(\\sigma = 0.5\\).\n\n\n4.1.4 Normal Error Regression Model\nIn the ice cream example, the relationship between expected amount and time holding the dispenser was given by a linear equation involving a single numeric explanatory variable. We can generalize this to situations with multiple explanatory variables, which might be numeric or categorical.\nIndividual observations are then assumed to vary from their expectation in accordance with a normal distribution, representing random noise (or error).\nThe mathematical form of a normal error linear regression model is\n\\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1}+ \\ldots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\epsilon_i\\), with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nNote that in place of \\(X_{ip}\\), we could have indicators for categories, or functions of \\(X_{ip}\\), such as \\(X_{ip}^2\\), \\(\\text{log}(X_{ip})\\), or \\(\\text{sin}(X_{ip})\\).\n\nThe quantities \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\) are parameters, pertaining to the true but unknown data generating mechanism.\nThe estimates \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\), are statistics, calculated from our observed data.\n\nWe use statistics \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) to obtain confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to make statements about parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\).\n\nAssumptions of Normal Error Regression Model\nWhen generating data for the ice cream machine, we assumed four things:\n\nLinearity - the expected amount of ice cream dispensed (i.e the signal) is a linear function of time the dispenser was pressed.\nConstant Variance - individual amounts dispensed varied from their expected amount with equal variability, regardless of the amount of time. That is, the amount of variability in individual amounts dispensed was the same for people who held the dispenser for 1 s. as for people who held it for 2 s. or 3 s., etc.\nNormality - individual amounts dispensed varied from their expected amount in accordance with a normal distribution.\nIndependence - the amount of ice cream dispensed for one person was not affected by the amount dispensed for anyone else.\n\nMore generally, the normal error regression model assumes:\n\nLinearity - the expected response is a linear function of the explanatory variable(s).\nConstant Variance - the variance between individual values of the response variable are the same for any values/categories of the explanatory variable(s)\nNormality - for any values/categories of the explanatory variable(s) individual response values vary from their expectation in accordance with a normal distribution.\nIndependence - individual response values are not affected by one another\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Examples of Normal Error Regression Model\nWe can formulate all of the examples we’ve worked with so far in terms of the normal error regression model.\nIn the house price example, consider the following models:\nModel 1:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nIf we use this model, we’re saying that we believe the expected price of a house is a linear function of its size, and that for any given size, the distribution of actual prices are normally distributed around their expected value of \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}\\). Furthermore, we’re saying that the amount of variability in house prices is the same for houses of any size.\nModel 2:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nIf we use this model, we’re saying that we believe the expected price of a house depends only on whether or not it is on the waterfront, and that prices of both waterfront and non-waterfront houses follow normal distributions. Though these distributions may have different means (\\(\\beta_0\\) for non-waterfront houses, and \\(\\beta_1\\) for waterfront houses), the amount of variability in prices should be the same for waterfront as non-waterfront houses.\nModel 3:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nand\nModel 4:\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nBoth of Models 3 and 4 assume that actual prices of houses with the same size and waterfront status are normally distributed, and that the mean of the normal distribution is a linear function of its size. Model 3 allows for the intercept of the lines to differ between waterfront and non-waterfront houses, while Model 4 allows both the intercept and slope to differ. Both assume that the amount of variability among houses of the same size and waterfront status is the same.\n\n\n4.1.6 Implications of Normal Error Regression Model\nIf we really believe that data come about as the normal error regression model describes, then probability theory tells us that regression coefficients \\(b_j\\)’s, representing differences between categories for categorical variables and rates of change for quantitative variables, follow symmetric and bell-shaped distributions. We can use this fact to create confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests, without needing to perform simulation. This is, in fact what R does in it’s model summary output.\nThese methods are only valid, however, if data can reasonably be thought of as having come from a process consistent with the assumptions of the normal error regression model process. If we don’t believe that our observed data can be reasonably thought of as having come from such a process, then the confidence intervals and p-values produced by R, and other places that rely on probability-based methods will not be reliable.\nWe close the section with a philosophical question:\nDo data really come about from processes like the normal error regression model? That is, do you think it is reasonable to believe that data we see in the real world (perhaps the amount of ice cream dispensed by an ice cream machine) represent independent outcomes of a process in which expected outcomes are a linear function of explanatory variables, and deviate from their expectation according to a normal distribution with constant variance?\nWe won’t attempt to answer that question here, but it is worth thinking about. After all, it is an assumption on which many frequently employed methods of statistical inference depends."

    "text": "4.2 Standard Error and Confidence Intervals\n\n4.2.1 Common Standard Error Formulas\nIn the normal error regression model, \\(\\sigma\\) is an unknown model parameter representing the standard deviation in response values among cases with the same values/categories of explanatory variable(s). We estimate \\(\\sigma\\) using the statistic\n\\(s =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}}\\).\n\\(s\\) is not the same as the standard errors of statistics we estimated using bootstrapping in Chapter 3. It is, however, related to these standard errors. In fact, standard errors for common statistics like sample means, differences in means, and regression coefficients can be approximated using formulas involving \\(s\\).\nSo far, we’ve used simulation (permutation tests and bootstrap intervals) to determine the amount of variability associated with a test statistic or estimate, in order to perform hypotheses tests and create confidence intervals. In special situations, there are mathematical formulas, based on probability theory, that can be used to approximate these standard errors without having to perform the simulations.\nTheory-Based Standard Error Formulas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic\nStandard Error\n\n\n\n\nSingle Mean\n\\(SE(b_0)=\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\nDifference in Means\n\\(SE(b_j)=s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\nSingle Proportion\n\\(SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\)\n\n\nDifference in Proportions\n\\(SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p_1}(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{\\hat{p_2}(1-\\hat{p_2})}{n_2}\\right)}\\)\n\n\nIntercept in Simple Linear Regression\n\\(SE(b_0)=s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\\)\n\n\nSlope in Simple Linear Regression\n\\(SE(b_1)=\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\frac{{\\sum(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{(n-(p+1))}}\\), (p is number of regression coefficients not including \\(b_0\\)). \\(s\\) is an estimate of the variability in the response variable among cases where the explanatory variable(s) are the same. Note that in the one-sample case, this simplifies to the standard deviation formula we’ve seen previously.\nIn the 2nd formula, the standard error estimate \\(s\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1+n_2}}\\) is called a “pooled” estimate since it combines information from all groups. When there is reason to believe standard deviation differs between groups, we often use an “unpooled” standard error estimate of \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\), where \\(s_1, s_2\\) represent the standard deviation for groups 1 and 2. This can be used in situations where the explanatory variable is categorical and we have doubts about the constant variance assumption.\n\nThere is no theory-based formula for standard error associated with the median or standard deviation. For these, and many other statistics, we rely on simulation to estimate variability between samples.\nThere are formulas for standard errors associated with coefficients in multiple regression, but these require mathematics beyond what is assumed in this class. They involve linear algebra and matrix inversion, which you can read about here if you are interested.\nWhen the sampling distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, approximate 95% confidence intervals can be calculated using the formula,\n\\[\n\\text{Statistic} \\pm 2\\times \\text{Standard Error},\n\\]\nwhere the standard error is estimated using a formula, rather than through bootstrapping.\nWe’ll go through some examples to illustrate how to calculate and interpret \\(s\\) and \\(SE(b_j)\\).\n\n\n4.2.2 Example: Difference in Means\nWe’ll use the normal error regression model to predict a lake’s mercury level, using location (N vs S) as the explanatory variable.\nThe regression model is:\n\\[\n\\text{Mercury} = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 \\times\\text{Location}_{\\text{South}} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\]\nThis model assumes:\n\nLinearity - there is no linearity assumption when the explanatory variable is categorical.\nConstant Variance - the variance between mercury levels of individual lakes is the same for Northern Florida, as for Southern Florida.\nNormality - mercury levels are normally distributed in Northern Florida and also in Southern Florida.\nIndependence - mercury levels of individual lakes are not affected by those of other lakes.\n\nThe lm summary command in R returns information pertaining to the model.\n\nLakes_M &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury ~ Location)\nsummary(Lakes_M)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

For example, if we believe there might be more variability in mercury levels among lakes with higher pH levels than lower ones (a violation of the constant variance assumption), or that lakes closer together are likely to have similar mercury levels (a violation of the independence assumption) then the results of the model might not be reliable.\nLater in this chapter, we’ll learn ways to check the appropriateness of these assumptions.

The t-distribution depends on a parameter called degrees of freedom, which determines the thickness of the distribution’s tails.\nWhen the sampling distribution for a statistic is symmetric and bell-shaped, it can be approximated by a t-distribution. As the sample size increases, so do the degrees of freedom in the t-distribution.\nAs the degrees of freedom grow large, we see that the t-distributions get closer together, converging to a bell-shaped curve. This distribution is called a standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 t-tests\nWhen the sampling distribution of a statistic is symmetric and bell-shaped, then the ratio\n\\[\nt= \\frac{{\\text{Statistic}}}{\\text{SE}(\\text{Statistic})}  \n\\]\napproximately follows a t-distribution.\nThe statistic \\(t\\) is called a t-statistic.\nWe’ll use this t-statistic as the test statistic in our hypothesis test.\nThe degrees of freedom are given by \\(n-(p+1)\\), where \\(p\\) represents the number of terms in the model, not including the intercept.\nTo find a p-value, we use a t-distribution to find the probability of obtaining a t-statistic as or more extreme than the one calculated from our data.\nA hypothesis test based on the t-statistic and t-distribution is called a t-test.\n\n\n4.3.3 t-test Examples\n\n4.3.3.1 Example 1: N vs S Lakes\nThe equation of the model is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Mercury}} = b_0+b_1\\times\\text{South}\n\\]\nWe fit the model in R and display its summary output below.\n\nLakes_M &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~Location)\nsummary(Lakes_M)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This corresponds to the locationS line of the R output.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average mercury levels between Northern and Southern Florida (\\(\\beta_1=0\\)).\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average mercury levels in Northern and Southern Florida (\\(\\beta_1\\neq 0\\)).\nIn the previous section, we calculated the standard error for \\(b_1\\) to be 0.0898, respectively.\nTest Statistic: \\(t=\\frac{{b_j}}{\\text{SE}(b_j)} = \\frac{0.27195}{0.0898} = 3.027\\)\nTo calculate the p-value, we plot the t-statistic of 3.027 that we observed in our data and observe where it lies on a t-distribution.\n\nts=3.027\ngf_dist(\"t\", df=51, geom = \"area\", fill = ~ (abs(x)&lt; abs(ts)), show.legend=FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept=c(ts, -ts), color=\"red\")  + xlab(\"t\")\n\n\n\n\nThe pt function returns the probability of getting a t-statistic higher than 3.027.

In more advanced and complicated models, it is common to encounter statistics of interest with unknown sampling distributions. In these cases, we can estimate p-values and build confidence intervals via simulation, even if we cannot identify the distribution by name.\nEven for statistics with known standard error formulas, the t-test is only appropriate when the sampling distribution for \\(b_j\\) is symmetric and bell-shaped. While there is probability theory that shows this will happen when the sample size is “large enough,” there is no set sample size that guarantees this. Datasets with heavier skewness in the response variable will require larger sample sizes than datasets with less skewness in the response.\nThe simulation-based approaches provide valuable insight to the logic behind hypothesis tests. When we permute values of an explanatory variable in a hypothesis test it is clear that we are simulating a situation where the null hypothesis is true. Likewise, when we simulate taking many samples in bootstrapping, it is clear that we are assessing the variability in a statistic across samples. Simply jumping to the t-based approximations of these distributions makes it easy to lose our sense of what they actually represent, and thus increases the likelihood of interpreting them incorrectly.\n\nIn fact prominent statistician R.A. Fisher wrote of simulation-based methods in 1936:\n“Actually, the statistician does not carry out this very simple and very tedious process, but his conclusions have no justification beyond the fact that they agree with those which could have been arrived at by this elementary method.”\nFisher’s comment emphasizes the fact that probability-based tests, like the t-test are simply approximations to what we would obtain via simulation-based approaches, which were not possible in his day, but are now.\nProponents of simulation-based inference include Tim Hesterberg, Senior Statistician at Instacart, and former Senior Statistician at Google, which heavily used simulation-based tests associated with computer experiments associated with their search settings. Hesterberg wrote a 2015 paper, arguing for the use and teaching of simulation-based techniques.\nWe will move forward by using probability-based inference where appropriate, while understanding that we are merely approximating what we would obtain via simulation. Meanwhile, we’ll continue to employ simulation-based approaches where probability-based techniques are inappropriate or unavailable."

It is defined by two parameters, \\(\\nu_1, \\nu_2\\), called numerator and denominator degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder certain conditions (which we’ll examine in the next chapter), the F-statistic\n\\[\nF=\\frac{\\frac{\\text{Unexplained Variability in Reduced Model}-\\text{Unexplained Variability in Full Model}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{Unexplained Variability in Full Model}}{n-(p+1)}}\n\\]\nfollows an F-distribution.\nThe numerator and denominator degrees of freedom are given by \\(p-q\\) and \\(n-(p+1)\\), respectively. These are the same values we divided by when computing the F-statistic.\n\n\n4.4.2 House Condition Example\nRecall the F-statistic for comparing prices of houses in either very good, good, or average condition, and the p-value associated with the simulation-based F-test we performed previously.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in average prices between houses of the three different conditions, among all houses in King County, WA.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average prices between houses of the three different conditions, among all houses in King County, WA.\nReduced Model: \\(\\text{Price}= \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\)\nFull Model: \\(\\text{Price}= \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 \\times\\text{good condition}+ \\beta_2\\times\\text{very good condition} + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{69,045,634-68,195,387}{2-0}}{\\frac{68,195,387}{100-(2+1)}} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n((SST - SSR_cond)/(2-0))/(SSR_cond/(100-(2+1)))\n\n[1] 0.6046888\n\n\nThe results of the simulation-based hypothesis test are shown below.\n\nHouse_Cond_SimulationResults_Plot\n\n\n\n\nsimulation-based p-value:\n\nmean(FSim &gt; Fstat)\n\n[1] 0.5548\n\n\nNow, we calculate the p-value using the probability-based F-distribution.\n\nts=0.605\ngf_dist(\"f\", df1=2, df2=97, geom = \"area\", fill = ~ (abs(x)&lt; abs(ts)), show.legend=FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept=c(ts), color=\"red\")  + xlab(\"F\")\n\n\n\n\np-value:\n\n1-pf(ts, df1=2, df2=97)\n\n[1] 0.5481219\n\n\nThe p-value we obtained is very similar to the one we obtained using the simulation-based test.\nWe can obtain this p-value directly using the anova command.\n\nM_cond &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price ~ condition)\nM0 &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price ~ 1)\nanova(M0, M_cond)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: price ~ 1\nModel 2: price ~ condition\n  Res.Df      RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1     99 69045634                           \n2     97 68195387  2    850247 0.6047 0.5483\n\n\nSince the p-value is large, we do not have enough evidence to say that average price differs between conditions of the houses.\n\n\n4.4.3 Interaction Example\nWe can also use an F-test to compare a model predicting house prices with an interaction term to one without one.\nReduced Model: \\(\\text{Price}= \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living} + \\beta_2\\times\\text{Waterfront} + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\)\nFull Model: \\(\\text{Price}= \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 \\times\\text{sqft\\_living}+ \\beta_2\\times\\text{Waterfront} + \\beta_3\\times\\text{sqft\\_living}\\times\\text{Waterfront} + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF &= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Reduced}}-\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{p-q}}{\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{Full}}}{n-(p+1)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{16,521,296-10,139,974}{3-2}}{\\frac{10,139,974}{100-(3+1)}} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n((SSR_wf_sqft-SSR_int)/(3-2))/((SSR_int)/(100-(3+1)))\n\n[1] 60.41505\n\n\n\nts=60.41505\ngf_dist(\"f\", df1=1, df2=96, geom = \"area\", fill = ~ (abs(x)&gt;! abs(ts)), show.legend=FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept=c(ts), color=\"red\")  + xlab(\"F\")\n\n\n\n\np-value:\n\n1-pf(ts, df1=1, df2=96)\n\n[1] 0.000000000008572476\n\n\nThe probability-based F-test is used in the anova command.\n\nM_wf_SqFt &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~sqft_living + waterfront)\nM_House_Int &lt;- lm(data=Houses, price~sqft_living * waterfront)\nanova(M_wf_SqFt, M_House_Int)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: price ~ sqft_living + waterfront\nModel 2: price ~ sqft_living * waterfront\n  Res.Df      RSS Df Sum of Sq      F            Pr(&gt;F)    \n1     97 16521296                                          \n2     96 10139974  1   6381323 60.415 0.000000000008572 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nSince the p-value is small, we have enough evidence to say that there is evidence of an interaction between size and whether or not the house is on the waterfront.\nNotice that this p-value is identical to the one we obtained in the previous section, using the t-test for interaction associated with the lm command."

    "text": "4.5 lm Summary in R\nWe’ve now seen how to obtain all of the quantities shown in the lm summary output in R. This section does not provide any new information, but brings together all of the information from the previous sections and chapters to show, in one place, how the lm summary output is obtained.\n\n4.5.1 lm summary Output\nThe summary command for a linear model in R displays a table including 4 columns.\nLinear Model summary() Output in R\n\nEstimate gives the least-squares estimates \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\)\nStandard Error gives estimates of the standard deviation in the sampling distribution for estimate. It tells us how the estimate is expected to vary between different samples of the given size. These are computed using the formulas in Section 4.2.\nt value is the estimate divided by its standard error.\nPr(&gt;|t|) is a p-value for the hypothesis test associated with the null hypothesis \\(\\beta_j = 0\\), where \\(\\beta_j\\) is the regression coefficient pertaining to the given line. Note that \\(\\beta_j\\) is the unknown population parameter estimated by \\(b_j\\).\nThe Residual Standard Error is \\(s =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{n-(p+1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{(n-(p+1))}}\\). This is an estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), which represents the standard deviation in the distribution of the response variable for given value(s) or category(ies) of explanatory variable(s). It tells us how much variability is expected in the response variable between different individuals with the same values/categories of the explanatory variables.\nThe degrees of freedom are \\(n-(p+1)\\).\nThe Multiple R-Squared value is the \\(R^2\\) value seen in Chapter 2. \\(R^2 = \\frac{\\text{SST} -\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y}_i)^2}\\)\nWe know that \\(R^2\\) can never decrease when additional variables are added to a model. The Adjusted-R^2 value is an alternate version of \\(R^2\\) that is designed to penalize adding variables that do little to explain variation in the response.\nThe F-statistic on the bottom line of the R-output corresponds to an F-test of the given model against a reduced model that include no explanatory variables. The p-value on this line is associated with the test of the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the response variable and any of the explanatory variables. Since SSR for this reduced model is equal to SST, the F-statistic calculation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ F=\\frac{\\frac{SST - SSR}{p}}{\\frac{SSR}{n-(p+1)}} \\]\nThe degrees of freedom associated with the F-statistic are given by \\(p\\) and \\((n-(p+1))\\).\nExample: Northern vs Southern Florida Lakes\nRecall our linear model for mercury levels of lakes in Northern Florida, compared to Southern Florida.\nThe equation of the model is:\n\\[\\text{Mercury} = \\beta\\_0+\\beta_1\\times\\text{South} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\]\nWe fit the model in R and display its summary output below.\n\nLakes_M &lt;- lm(data=FloridaLakes, Mercury~Location)\nsummary(Lakes_M)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Mercury ~ Location, data = FloridaLakes)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.65650 -0.23455 -0.08455  0.24350  0.67545 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "4.6 Intervals for Expected Response\n\n4.6.1 Parameter Values and Expected Responses\nRecall that in Chapter 4, we saw two different types of confidence intervals. One type was for regression parameters, \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\), using estimate \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\). The other type was for expected responses, which involved estimating linear functions of these parameters, for example \\(\\beta_0 + 7\\beta_1\\).\nUnder the assumptions of a normal error regression model, we an approximate 95% confidence interval for regression parameter \\(\\beta_j\\) is given by\n\\[ b_j + \\pm t^*\\text{SE}(b_j), \\]\nwhere \\(t^*\\approx 2\\).\nWe’ve seen that in R, confidence intervals for regression parameters can be obtained through the confint() command.\nA 95% confidence interval for an expected response \\(E(Y_i|X_{i1}=x_{i1}, \\ldots X_{ip}=x_{ip}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_px_{ip}\\) is estimated by\n\\[ b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip} \\pm t^*\\text{SE}(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}), \\]\nIn this section, we’ll look more into confidence intervals for expected responses and also another kind of interval involving expected responses, called a prediction interval.\nWell sometimes write \\(E(Y_i|X_{i1}=x_{i1}, \\ldots X_{ip}=x_{ip})\\) as \\(E(Y|X)\\).\n\n\n4.6.2 Estimation and Prediction\nRecall the ice cream dispenser that is known to dispense ice cream at a rate of 2 oz. per second on average, with individual amounts varying according to a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5\nConsider the following two questions:\n\nOn average, how much ice cream will be dispensed for people who press the dispenser for 1.5 seconds?\nIf a single person presses the dispenser for 1.5 seconds, how much ice cream will be dispensed?\n\nThe first question is one of estimation. The second pertains to prediction.\nWhen estimating expected responses and making predictions on new observations, there are two sources of variability we must consider.\n\nWe are using data to estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), which introduces sampling variability.\n\nEven if we did know \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), there is variability in individual observations, which follows a \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) distribution.\n\nIn an estimation problem, we only need to think about (1). When predicting the value of a single new observation, we need to think about both (1) and (2).\nThus, intervals for predictions of individual observations carry more uncertainty and are wider than confidence intervals for \\(E(Y|X)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2.1 Example: Ice Cream Machine\nIn the estimation setting, we are trying to determine the location of the regression line for the entire population. Uncertainty comes from the fact that we only have data from a sample.\nIn the ice cream example, we can see that the blue line, fit to our data, is a good approximation of the “true” regression line that pertains to the mechanism from which the data were generated. It does, however, vary from the red line slightly due to sampling variability.\n\nggplot(data=Icecream1, aes(x=time, y=amount)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Icecream Dispensed\") + xlab(\"Time Pressing dispenser\") + ylab(\"Amount Dispensed\") + geom_abline(slope=2, intercept=0, color=\"red\") + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(IC_Model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lm(amount ~ time), data = Icecream1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-0.8645 -0.3553  0.0685  0.2252  0.6963 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It is of the form, for a given \\(X\\), on average what do we expect to be true of \\(Y\\).\nIn the ice cream question, we can answer this exactly, since we know \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nIn a real situation, we don’t know these and have to estimate them from the data, which introduces uncertainty.\nConfidence interval for \\(E(Y | (X=x))\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*SE(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*) \\\\\n& b_0+b_1x^* \\pm t^*\\sqrt{\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{Y}|X=x^*)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe second question is a question of prediction.

    "text": "4.8 Responsible Statistical Inference\nWhile statistics offer insight that have lead to great advances in science, medicine, business and economics and many other areas, they have also been misused, (either intentionally or unintentionally) in ways that have resulted in harm. In an effort to better educate the public, the American Statistical Association released a report in 2016, highlighting common misuses of p-values, and the notion of statistical significance. Kenneth Rothman, Professor of Epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health wrote:\n\n“(S)cientists have embraced and even avidly pursued meaningless differences solely because they are statistically significant, and have ignored important effects because they failed to pass the screen of statistical significance…It is a safe bet that people have suffered or died because scientists (and editors, regulators, journalists and others) have used significance tests to interpret results, and have consequently failed to identify the most beneficial courses of action.” -ASA statement on p-values, 2016\n\nIn this section, we’ll look at some real scenarios where it might be tempting to make an improper conclusion based on data. Think carefully about each scenario and identify possible misinterpretations that might arise. Then think about what conclusions or actions would be appropriate in each scenario.\nKeep in mind the following guidelines for responsible statistical inference.\nWhat a p-value tells us\nPerforming responsible statistical inference requires understanding what p-values do and do not tell us, and how they should and should not be interpreted.\n\nA low p-value tells us that the data we observed are inconsistent with our null hypothesis or some assumption we make in our model.\nA large p-value tells us that the data we observed could have plausibly been obtained under our supposed model and null hypothesis.\nA p-value never provides evidence supporting the null hypothesis, it only tells us the strength of evidence against it.\nA p-value is impacted by\n\nthe size of the difference between group, or change per unit increase (effect size)\n\nthe amount of variability in the data\n\nthe sample size\n\nSometimes, a p-value tells us more about sample size, than relationship we’re actually interested in.\nA p-value does not tell us the “size” of a difference or effect, or whether it is practically meaningful.\nWe should only generalize results from a hypothesis test performed on a sample to a larger population or process if the sample is representative of the population or process (such as when the sample is randomly selected).\nA correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.\n\n\n4.8.1 Breakfast Cereals and Sex of Babies\nThe title of a 2008 article by New Scientist makes a surprising claim: “Breakfast cereals boost chances of conceiving boys.” Although the article lacks details on the underlying study, researchers, in fact, tracked the eating habits of women who were attempting to become pregnant. They tracked 133 different food items, and tested whether there was a difference in the proportion of baby boys conceived between women who ate the food, compared to those who didn’t. Of the 133 foods tested, only breakfast cereal showed a significant difference.\nQuestion: Why is the researcher’s conclusion that eating breakfast cereal increases the chances of conceiving a boy inappropriate? Hint: think about how this situation is similar to the one in the xkcd comic?\nA statistical procedure called the Bonferroni Correction suggests that when more than one test is performed simultaneously, we should multiply observed p-values by the number of tests performed.

    "text": "5.1 Checking Regression Assumptions\nWe’ve seen that tests and intervals based on the normal error regression model depend on four assumptions. If these assumptions are not reasonable then the tests and intervals may not be reliable.\nThe statement \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1}+ \\ldots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\epsilon_i\\), with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\) implies the following:\n\nLinearity: the expected value of \\(Y\\) is a linear function of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\). (This assumption is only relevant for models including at least one quantitative explanatory variable.)\nNormality: Given the values of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\), \\(Y\\) follows a normal distribution.\nConstant Variance: Regardless of the values of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\), the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for \\(Y\\) is the same.\nIndependence: The response value for each observation is not affected by any of the other observations (expect due to explanatory variables included in the model).\n\nIllustration of Model Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that these assumptions held true in the ice cream example, because we generated the data in a way that was consistent with these.\nIn practice, we will have only the data, without knowing the exact mechanism that produced it. We should only rely on the t-distribution based p-values and confidence intervals in the R output if these appear to be reasonable assumptions.\nOf course, these assumptions will almost never be truly satisfied, but they should at least be a reasonable approximation if we are to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n5.1.1 Checking Model Assumptions\nThe following plots are useful when assessing the appropriateness of the normal error regression model.\n\nScatterplot of residuals against predicted values\nHistogram of standardized residuals\n\nheavy skewness indicates a problem with normality assumption\n\nNormal quantile plot\n\nsevere departures from diagonal line indicate problem with normality assumption\n\n\nResidual vs Predicted Plots\nA residual vs predicted plot is useful for detecting issues with the linearity or constant variance assumption.\n\ncurvature indicates a problem with linearity assumption\n\n“funnel” or “megaphone” shape indicates problem with constant variance assumption\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=no_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=lin_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Linearity Assumption\")+ xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(y=cvar_viol_Model$residuals, x=no_viol_Model$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Constant Variance Assumption\")+ xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nIf there is only one explanatory variable, plotting the residuals against that variable reveals the same information as a residual vs predicted plot.\nHistogram of Residuals\nA histogram of the residuals is useful for assessing the normality assumption.\n\nSevere skewness indicates violation of normality assumption\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(x=no_viol_Model$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") +xlab(\"Residual\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(x=norm_viol_Model$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Violation of Normality Assumption\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nNormal Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot\nSometimes histograms can be inconclusive, especially when sample size is smaller.\nA Normal quantile-quantile plot displays quantiles of the residuals against the expected quantiles of a normal distribution.\n\nSevere departures from diagonal line indicate a problem with normality assumption.\n\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(sample = scale(no_viol_Model$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"No Violation\") + xlim(c(-4,4)) + ylim(c(-4,4))\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Violations, aes(sample = scale(norm_viol_Model$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Violation of Normality Assumption\") + xlim(c(-4,4)) + ylim(c(-4,4))\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nChecking Model Assumptions - Independence\nIndependence is often difficult to assess through plots of data, but it is important to think about whether there were factors in the data collection that would cause some observations to be more highly correlated than others.\nFor example:\n\nPeople in the study who are related.\n\nSome plants grown in the same greenhouse and others in different greenhouses.\n\nSome observations taken in same time period and others at different times.\n\nAll of these require more complicated models that account for correlation using spatial and time structure.\n\n\n5.1.2 Summary of Checks for Model Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel assumption\nHow to detect violation\n\n\n\n\nLinearity\nCurvature in residual plot\n\n\nConstant Variance\nFunnel shape in residual plot\n\n\nNormality\nSkewness in histogram of residuals or departure from diag. line in QQ plot\n\n\nIndependence\nNo graphical check, carefully examine data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Example: N v S Lakes\nRecall our sample of 53 Florida Lakes, 33 in the north, and 20 in the south.\n\\(\\text{Mercury}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times{\\text{South}_i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\).\n\nLakesBP\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use the normal error regression model, we are assuming the following:\n\nLinearity: there is an expected mercury concentration for lakes in North Florida, and another for lakes in South Florida.\nNormality: mercury concentrations of individual lakes in the north are normally distributed, and so are mercury concentrations in the south. These normal distributions might have different means.\nConstant Variance: the normal distribution for mercury concentrations in North Florida has the same standard deviation as the normal distribution for mercury concentrations in South Florida\nIndependence: no two lakes are any more alike than any others, except for being in the north or south, which we account for in the model. We might have concerns about this, do to some lakes being geographically closer to each other than others.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nA residual by predicted plot, histogram of residuals, and normal quantile-quantile plot are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=Lakes_M$residuals, x=Lakes_M$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(x=Lakes_M$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(sample = scale(Lakes_M$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we see two lines of predicted values and residuals. This makes sense since all lakes in North Florida will have the same predicted value, as will all lakes in Southern Florida.\nThere appears to be a little more variability in residuals for Southern Florida (on the right), than Northern Florida, causing some concern about the constant variance assumption.\nOverall, though, the assumptions seem mostly reasonable.\nWe shouldn’t be concerned about using theory-based hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for the mean mercury level or difference in mean mercury levels. There might be some concern that prediction intervals could be either too wide or too narrow, but this is not a major concern, since the constant variance assumption is not severe.\n\n\n5.1.4 Example: pH Model\nRecall the regression line estimating the relationship between a lake’s mercury level and pH.\n\\(\\text{Mercury}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times\\text{pH}_i + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\).\nThe model assumes:\n\nLinearity: the expected mercury level of a lake is a linear function of pH.\nNormality: for any given pH, the mercury levels of lakes with that pH follow a normal distribution. For example, mercury levels for lakes with pH of 6 is are normally distributed, and mercury levels for lakes with pH of 9 are normally distributed, though these normal distributions may have different means.\nConstant Variance: the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for mercury level is the same for each pH. For example, there is the same amount of variability associated with lakes with pH level 6, as pH level 8.\nIndependence: no two lakes are any more alike than any others, except with respect to pH, which is accounted for in the model. This may not be a reasonable assumption, but it’s unclear what the effects of such a violation would be.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nThe plots for checking these assumptions are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(y=M_pH$residuals, x=M_pH$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(x=M_pH$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=FloridaLakes, aes(sample = scale(M_pH$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nThe residual vs predicted plot does not show any linear trend, and variability appears to be about the same for low predicted values as for high ones. Thus, the linearity and constant variance assumptions appear reasonable.\nThe histogram shows some right-skewness, and the right-most points on the normal-qq plot are above the line, indicating a possible concern with the normality assumption. There is some evidence of right-skewness, which might impact the appropriatness of the normal error regression model.\nNevertheless, we obtained similar results using the simulation-based results as the normal error regression model, suggesting that the concern about normality did not have much impact on the estimation of \\(\\beta_1\\). It is possible that this concern could have implications for other kinds of inference, such as confidence intervals for an expected response, and prediction intervals, which we’ll explore later in the chapter.\n\n\n5.1.5 Example: House Prices\nRecall the model for estimating price of a house, using size, waterfront status, and an interaction term.\n\\(\\text{Price}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Sq.Ft.}_{i}+ \\beta_2\\text{Waterfront}_{i}+ \\beta_3\\times\\text{Sq.Ft.}_i\\times\\text{Waterfront}_{i} + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nThe model assumes:\n\nLinearity: the expected price of a house is a linear function of its size. The slope and intercept of this function may be different for houses on the waterfront, compared to houses not on the waterfront.\nNormality: prices of houses of a given size and waterfront status are normally distributed.\nConstant Variance: the variance (or standard deviation) in the normal distribution for prices is the same for all sizes and waterfront statuses.\nIndependence: no two houses are any more alike than any others, except with respect to size and waterfront status.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nSeveral reasons come to mind that might cause us to doubt the validity of these assumptions, but let’s investigate them emperically, using our data on 100 houses.\nThe plots for checking these assumptions are shown below.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(y=M_House_Int$residuals, x=M_House_Int$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual vs Predicted Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(x=M_House_Int$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Houses, aes(sample = scale(M_House_Int$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Normal QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we might have had some initial concerns about the model assumptions, the plots do not raise any serious concerns. There is no sign of a nonlinear relationship in the residual vs predicted plot, so the linearity assumption appears reasonable.\nThere is possibly more variability associated with prices or more expensive houses than less expensive ones, so we might have some concerns about constant variance, but since there are only a few very high-priced houses, and the increasing variance is not too severe, this may not be much of a concern.\nThere are a few houses on each end of the normal qq plot that deviate from their expected line, but not very many. It’s not uncommon to have a few points deviate from the line on the end, so we do not have severe concerns about normality. The histogram of residuals is roughly symmetric.\nThus, the normal error regression model appears to be reasonable for these data.\n\n\n5.1.6 Impact of Model Assumption Violations\nIn this chapter, we’ve studied the normal error regression model and its underlying assumptions. We’ve seen that when these assumptions are realistic, we can use distributions derived from probability theory, such as t and F distributions to approximate sampling distributions, in place of the simulation-based methods seen in Chapters 3 and 4.\nOf course, real data don’t come exactly from processes like the fictional ice cream dispenser described in Section 5.1, so it’s really a question of whether this model is a realistic approximation (or simplification) of the true mechanism that led to the data we observe. We can use diagnostics like residual and Normal-QQ plots, as well as our intuition and background knowledge to assess whether the normal error regression model is a reasonable approximation.\nThe p-values provided by the lm summary output, and anova commands, and the and intervals produced by the confint, and predict command, as well as many other R commands, depend on the assumptions of the normal error regression model, and should only be used when these assumptions are reasonable.\nIn situations where some model assumptions appear to be violated, we might be okay using certain tests/intervals, but not others. In general, we should proceed with caution in these situations.\nThe table below provides guidance on the potential impact of model assumption violation on predicted values, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel assumption Violated\nPredicted Values\nConfidence Intervals\nPrediction Intervals\n\n\n\n\nLinearity\nUnreliable\nUnreliable\nUnreliable\n\n\nConstant Variance\nReliable\nSomewhat unreliable - Some too wide, others too narrow\nVery unreliable - Some too wide, others too narrow\n\n\nNormality\nReliable\nPossibly unreliable - might be symmetric when they shouldn’t be.

There is also some concern about the normality assumption, as the histogram and QQ plot indicate right-skew in the residuals.\n\n\n5.2.2 Log Transformation\nWhen residual plots yield model inadequacy, we might try to correct these by applying a transformation to the response variable.\nWhen working a nonnegative, right-skewed response variable, it is often helpful to work with the logarithm of the response variable.\nNote: In R, log() denotes the natural (base e) logarithm, often denoted ln(). We can actually use any logarithm, but the natural logarithm is commonly used.\nWe’ll use the model:\n\\[\n\\text{Log Price} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\times \\text{Acc060} + \\epsilon_i , \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\]\nThe plot shows log(price) on the y-axis. We see that the relationship appears more linear than when we plot price itself.\n\nggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(x=Acc060, y=log(Price))) + geom_point() + \n  xlab(\"Acceleration Time\") + ylab(\"Log of Price\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Acceleration Time and Log Price\") + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nLog Transformation Model - What We’re Assuming\n\nLinearity: the log of expected price of a car is a linear function of its acceleration time.\nNormality: for any given acceleration time, the log of prices of actual cars follow a normal distribution.\nConstant Variance: the normal distribution for log of price is the same for all acceleration times.\nIndependence: no two cars are any more alike than any others.\n\nWe should only use the p-values and confidence intervals provided by R, which depend on the t-distribution approximation, if we believe these assumptions are reasonable.\nAssumption Check for Model on Log Price\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(y=Cars_M_Log$residuals, x=Cars_M_Log$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Cars Log Model Residual Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(x=Cars_M_Log$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Cars2015, aes(sample = scale(Cars_M_Log$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"Cars Model QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nThere is still some concern about constant variance, though perhaps not as much. The normality assumption appears more reasonable.\n\n\n5.2.3 Inference for Log Model\nR output for the model is shown below.\n\nCars_M_Log &lt;- lm(data=Cars2015, log(Price)~Acc060)\nsummary(Cars_M_Log)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(Price) ~ Acc060, data = Cars2015)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.84587 -0.19396  0.00908  0.18615  0.53350 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It also gives non-symmetric intervals. These results appear to be consistent with the observed data.\n\n\n5.2.7 Comments on Transformations\n\nWe could have used another transformation, such as \\(\\sqrt{\\text{Price}}\\)\nThe log tranform leads to a nice interpretation involving percent change. Other transformations might yield better predictions, but are often hard to interpret.\nThere is often a tradeoff between model complexity and interpretability. We’ll talk more about this.\nWe did an example of a transformation in a model with a single explanatory variable.\nIf the explanatory variable is categorical:\n\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the expected response in the baseline category\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_j}\\) represents the number of times larger the expected response in category \\(j\\) is, compared to the baseline category.\n\nWhen working with multiple regression models, it is still important to mention holding other variables constant when interpreting parameters associated with one of the variables."

    "text": "5.3 Building Models for Interpretation: Confounding, Multicollinearity, and Polynomial Regression\nSo far, we’ve dealt with models with 2 or fewer variables. Some real questions require accounting for more than two variables. In these situations, we’ll need to develop a model that is complex enough to capture the important aspects of the mechanism we’re modeling, but also simple enough for us to be able to explain and interpret. We’ll need to decide how many variables to include in the model, and whether to use transformations, or to include interaction terms.\nWe’ll examine strategies for modeling in two different contexts. In this chapter, we’ll focus on building models for situations when we want to make interpretations and draw conclusions about relationships between variables. In Chapter 7, we focus on modeling solely for the purpose of prediction, when we are not interested in making interpretations or conclusions about relationships between variables.\nWhen building a model for the purpose of interpretation, we are typically interested in investigating a research question pertaining to relationships between explanatory and response variables. We’ll need to think about things like:\n\nwhich explanatory variables should we include in the model, and how many?\n\nshould we include any interaction terms?\n\nshould we use any nonlinear terms?\n\nshould we use a transformation of the response variable?\n\nWe’ll go through a couple example to see how we can address these questions in building a model.\nKeep in mind, there is no single correct model, but there are common characteristics of a good model. While two statisticians might use different models for a given set of data, they will hopefully lead to reasonably similar conclusions if constructed carefully.\n\n5.3.1 Modeling SAT Scores\nWe’ll now look at a dataset containing education data on all 50 states. It includes the following variables.\nstate - a factor with names of each state\nexpend - expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance in public elementary and secondary schools, 1994-95 (in thousands of US dollars)\nratio - average pupil/teacher ratio in public elementary and secondary schools, Fall 1994\nsalary - estimated average annual salary of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools, 1994-95 (in thousands of US dollars)\nfrac - percentage of all eligible students taking the SAT, 1994-95\nsat - average total SAT score, 1994-95\nregion - region of the country\n\nlibrary(mosaicData)\ndata(SAT)\nSAT &lt;- SAT %&gt;% dplyr::select(-c(verbal, math))\nlibrary(Lock5Data)\ndata(\"USStates\")\nSAT &lt;- SAT %&gt;% left_join(USStates %&gt;% select(State, Region), by=c(\"state\"=\"State\")) %&gt;% rename(region = Region)\n\n\nSAT\n\n            state expend ratio salary frac  sat region\n1         Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8 1029      S\n2          Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47  934      W\n3         Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27  944      W\n4        Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6 1005      S\n5      California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45  902      W\n6        Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29  980      W\n7     Connecticut  8.817  14.4 50.045   81  908     NE\n8        Delaware  7.030  16.6 39.076   68  897     NE\n9         Florida  5.718  19.1 32.588   48  889      S\n10        Georgia  5.193  16.3 32.291   65  854      S\n11         Hawaii  6.078  17.9 38.518   57  889      W\n12          Idaho  4.210  19.1 29.783   15  979      W\n13       Illinois  6.136  17.3 39.431   13 1048     MW\n14        Indiana  5.826  17.5 36.785   58  882     MW\n15           Iowa  5.483  15.8 31.511    5 1099     MW\n16         Kansas  5.817  15.1 34.652    9 1060     MW\n17       Kentucky  5.217  17.0 32.257   11  999     MW\n18      Louisiana  4.761  16.8 26.461    9 1021      S\n19          Maine  6.428  13.8 31.972   68  896     NE\n20       Maryland  7.245  17.0 40.661   64  909     NE\n21  Massachusetts  7.287  14.8 40.795   80  907     NE\n22       Michigan  6.994  20.1 41.895   11 1033     MW\n23      Minnesota  6.000  17.5 35.948    9 1085     MW\n24    Mississippi  4.080  17.5 26.818    4 1036      S\n25       Missouri  5.383  15.5 31.189    9 1045     MW\n26        Montana  5.692  16.3 28.785   21 1009      W\n27       Nebraska  5.935  14.5 30.922    9 1050     MW\n28         Nevada  5.160  18.7 34.836   30  917      W\n29  New Hampshire  5.859  15.6 34.720   70  935     NE\n30     New Jersey  9.774  13.8 46.087   70  898     NE\n31     New Mexico  4.586  17.2 28.493   11 1015      W\n32       New York  9.623  15.2 47.612   74  892     NE\n33 North Carolina  5.077  16.2 30.793   60  865      S\n34   North Dakota  4.775  15.3 26.327    5 1107     MW\n35           Ohio  6.162  16.6 36.802   23  975     MW\n36       Oklahoma  4.845  15.5 28.172    9 1027      S\n37         Oregon  6.436  19.9 38.555   51  947      W\n38   Pennsylvania  7.109  17.1 44.510   70  880     NE\n39   Rhode Island  7.469  14.7 40.729   70  888     NE\n40 South Carolina  4.797  16.4 30.279   58  844      S\n41   South Dakota  4.775  14.4 25.994    5 1068     MW\n42      Tennessee  4.388  18.6 32.477   12 1040      S\n43          Texas  5.222  15.7 31.223   47  893      S\n44           Utah  3.656  24.3 29.082    4 1076      W\n45        Vermont  6.750  13.8 35.406   68  901     NE\n46       Virginia  5.327  14.6 33.987   65  896      S\n47     Washington  5.906  20.2 36.151   48  937      W\n48  West Virginia  6.107  14.8 31.944   17  932      S\n49      Wisconsin  6.930  15.9 37.746    9 1073     MW\n50        Wyoming  6.160  14.9 31.285   10 1001      W\n\n\nNote that the dataset is quite old (from 1994-95), so the financial information may be out of date. Nevertheless, it is useful for exploring relationships between SAT scores and other variables.\nResearch Question\nA good statistical research question should be one that has practical implications that people would care about. It should be complex enough to be worth investigating. If the answer is obvious, then there would be no need to use statistics, or scientific reasoning in general.\nFor the SAT score dataset, we’ll focus on the question:\nDo students in states that prioritize education spending achieve better SAT scores?\nWhile this may seem like a straightforward question, we’ll see that answering it properly requires careful thought and analysis.\n\n5.3.1.1 Initial Model\nOne way to measure a state’s investment in education is in how much it pays its teachers. The plot displays average SAT score against average teacher salary for all 50 US states.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes(y=sat, x=salary)) + geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + \n  ggtitle(\"Average SAT score vs Average Teacher Salary\") + \n  xlab(\"Average Teacher Salary in Thousands\") \n\n\n\n\nFitting a simple linear regression model to the data, we obtain the following:\n\nSAT_M1 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary)\nsummary(SAT_M1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-147.125  -45.354    4.073   42.193  125.279 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The low p-value suggests a relationship like this is unlikely to occur by chance, though the practical importance of a 5-point decrease in SAT score (out of 1600) seems minimal. Furthermore, only 19% of the total variation in SAT score is explained by teaching salary. Nevertheless, a person looking to argue against raising teacher salaries might use the negative estimate and low p-value as a justification for their position.\n\n\n5.3.1.2 A Deeper Investigation\nNotice that there are large discrepancies in the frac variable, representing the percentage of students taking the SAT. In Connecticut, 81% of high school students took the SAT, compared to only 6% in Arkansas.\nLet’s break the data down by the percentage of students who take the SAT. We’ll (somewhat arbitrarily), divide the states into\nLow = 0%-22%\nMedium = 22-49%\nHigh = 49-81%\n\nSAT &lt;- mutate(SAT, fracgrp = cut(frac, \n      breaks=c(0, 22, 49, 81), \n      labels=c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")))\n\nPlotting SAT score against average teacher salary in each state, we see that the picture changes.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes( y=sat, x=salary )) +geom_point() + facet_wrap(facets = ~fracgrp) +\nstat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + xlab(\"Average Teacher Salary in Thousands\")\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a slight positive relationship between teacher salary and SAT score in each state.\nWhile breaking up the data into these three groups helps us visualize, we’ll simply add the frac variable to the model as a quantitative variable, rather than breaking it into these arbitrary categories.\n\nSAT_M2 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary+frac)\nsummary(SAT_M2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary + frac, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-78.313 -26.731   3.168  18.951  75.590 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

While the effect of a 2 point increase per $1,000 in average teacher salary might seem small, the ~3 point decrease for each percentage point of students taking the exam is quite meaningful. According to the model, if the percentage of students taking the SAT is 10 percentage points higher than another, and the states pay their teachers the same, then the state with more people taking the exam is expected to have an average score almost 30 points lower.\nAdding percentage of students taking the exam increased the \\(R^2\\) value substantially.\nWe see that the relationship between SAT score and salary appears to reverse when we account for percentage of students taking the test. States with low percentages of people taking the SAT tend to get higher scores, as the people taking the test tend to be those who are best prepared and have strong incentive for taking it, perhaps because they are trying to get into an elite college. At the same time, states that pay their teachers more tend to have higher percentages of people taking the SAT. This may be because states that prioritize education are more likely to cover the cost of students taking the test, or even to require it. It may also be that many of the states that require the SAT are coastal states, where cost of living, and thus teacher salaries, tend to be higher in general. Thus, it appears initially that teacher salaries are negatively correlated with SAT scores, but after accounting for percentage taking the test, the trend reverses. Situations where an apparent trend disappears or reverses after accounting for another variable are called Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n\n5.3.1.3 Student-to-Teacher Ratio\nLet’s see what other possible explanatory variables we might want to add to the model. Keep in mind that our goal is to understand the relationship between teacher salary and SAT scores in the state, so we should only use variables that help us understand this relationship.\nIn addition to teacher salaries, student-to-teacher ratio might be an indication of a state’s investment in education. We’ll add student-to-teacher ratio to the model and explore whether there is evidence that hiring enough teachers to keep student-to-teacher ratio low has a benefit, in terms of SAT score.\n\nSAT_M3 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary+frac+ratio)\nsummary(SAT_M3)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary + frac + ratio, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-89.244 -21.485  -0.798  17.685  68.262 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

This suggests that states should try to keep student to teacher ratios low. We see teacher salary remains positively correlated with SAT score and percentage taking the test remains negatively correlated, after accounting for student to teacher ratio.\n\n\n5.3.1.4 Multicollinearity\nNext, let’s add the variable expend, which measures the state’s expenditure per pupil.\n\nSAT_M4 &lt;- lm(data=SAT, sat~salary+frac+ratio+expend)\nsummary(SAT_M4)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sat ~ salary + frac + ratio + expend, data = SAT)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-90.531 -20.855  -1.746  15.979  66.571 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Likewise, while student-to-teacher ratio is still negatively associated, it too has a large p-value. Also notice that \\(R^2\\) barely increased when accounting for total expenditures.\nThis happens because expenditures are highly correlated with teacher salary. States that pay their teacher more also spend more on education per pupil. The scatterplot matrix below shows a strong correlation of 0.87 between teacher salary and expenditures.\n\nSAT_Num &lt;- select_if(SAT, is.numeric)\nC &lt;- cor(SAT_Num, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\nround(C,2)\n\n       expend ratio salary  frac   sat\nexpend   1.00 -0.37   0.87  0.59 -0.38\nratio   -0.37  1.00   0.00 -0.21  0.08\nsalary   0.87  0.00   1.00  0.62 -0.44\nfrac     0.59 -0.21   0.62  1.00 -0.89\nsat     -0.38  0.08  -0.44 -0.89  1.00\n\n\n\nlibrary(corrplot)\ncorrplot(C)\n\n\n\n\nBecause these variables are highly correlated, it doesn’t make sense to talk about the effect of increasing teacher salary, while holding expenditure constant, or vice-versa. Notice the standard error on the salary line in model SAT_M4 (which includes expenditures) is more than twice as high as in SAT_M3, which did not. This happens because the model is not able to separate the effect of salary from the effect of expenditure, and thus becomes very uncertain of the effect of both, resulting in high standard errors. In addition to reducing the t-statistic, and increasing the p-value, this leads to much wider and less informative confidence intervals associated with the effect of teacher salary.\nConfidence intervals for model involving teacher salary, percentage taking the test, and student-to-teacher ratio.\n\nconfint(SAT_M3)\n\n                  2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept) 968.6691802 1147.1271438\nsalary        0.5304797    4.5744605\nfrac         -3.3727807   -2.4539197\nratio        -8.9098147   -0.3690414\n\n\nConfidence intervals for model with above variables plus expenditure.\n\nconfint(SAT_M4)\n\n                 2.5 %      97.5 %\n(Intercept) 939.486374 1152.456698\nsalary       -3.170247    6.446081\nfrac         -3.370262   -2.438699\nratio       -10.100417    2.851952\nexpend      -16.779204   25.704393\n\n\nModels with highly correlated explanatory variables suffer from multicollinearity, which increases standard errors, making the effect of variables harder to discern. When we have explanatory variables that are highly correlated (usually with correlation greater than 0.8), we should pick out just one to include in the model. In this case, we’ll stick with teacher salary.\n\n\n5.3.1.5 Check Model Assumptions\nLet’s return to the model with salary, ratio, and fraction taking test. We use residual plots to assess model assumptions.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(y=SAT_M3$residuals, x=SAT_M3$fitted.values)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual Plot\") + xlab(\"Predicted Values\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(x=SAT_M3$residuals)) + geom_histogram() + ggtitle(\"Histogram of Residuals\") + xlab(\"Residual\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(sample = scale(SAT_M3$residuals))) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + xlab(\"Normal Quantiles\") + ylab(\"Residual Quantiles\") + ggtitle(\"QQ Plot\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nThere is some sign of a quadratic trend in the residual plot, creating concern about the linearity assumption.\nIn models with multiple explanatory variables, it is helpful to also plot our residuals against the explanatory variables to see whether the model is properly accounting for relationships involving each variable. If we see nonlinear trends, we should consider adding a nonlinear function of that explanatory variable.\n\nP1 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(y=SAT_M3$residuals, x=SAT_M3$model$salary)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual by Predictor Plot\") + xlab(\"Salary\") + ylab(\"Residuals\") \nP2 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(y=SAT_M3$residuals, x=SAT_M3$model$frac)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual by Predictor Plot\") + xlab(\"Fraction Taking Test\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\nP3 &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(SAT_M3$residuals), aes(y=SAT_M3$residuals, x=SAT_M3$model$ratio)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Residual by Predictor Plot\") + xlab(\"Student to Teach Ratio\") + ylab(\"Residuals\")\ngrid.arrange(P1, P2, P3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a quadratic trend in the plot involving the fraction variable.

In fact, the vertex of the parabola given by \\(y=-6.64x + 0.05x^2\\) occurs at \\(x=\\frac{6.64}{2(0.05)}\\approx 66\\). So the model estimates that SAT score decreases in a quadratic fashion with respect to fraction taking the test, until that fraction reaches 66 percent of student, then is expected to increase.\n\nggplot(data=SAT, aes(x=frac, y=sat)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nWe do see some possible quadratic trend, but we should be really careful about extrapolation.

This happens because now we are only comparing states in the same region of the country. The p-value associated with teacher salary is now testing the null hypothesis “There is no relationship between average teacher salary and SAT score among states in the same region of the country, with the same percentage of students taking the test, and same student to teacher ratio.”\nBecause we only have 50 states to begin with, breaking down by region results in small sample sizes, which contributes to the large p-values. Furthermore, it is unclear why we would need to account for region here. If our goal is to assess the impact of educational spending on SAT scores, it is probably okay to compare states in different regions of the country. Unless we have some reason for wanting to compare states in the same region, we shouldn’t include region as an explanatory variable (even though including it did raise our \\(R^2\\) value above 0.9). In general, we should only include variables if they help us address our research question. In this case, it’s not clear that accounting for region helps us better understand the relationship between a state’s investment in education, and its students average SAT scores.\nIt is important to note that we should not decide whether to include a variable based on whether or not it yielded a small p-value. Adding or deleting variables from a model until we get a desired p-value on a variable we’re interested in can lead to Confirmation bias (that is choosing our model in a way that intentionally confirms what we expected or hoped to be true), and to detecting spurious correlations that will not be replicable in future studies. This phenomenon, known as p-hacking has led to incorrect and unethical conclusions.

    "text": "6.1 Logistic Regression\n\n6.1.1 Modeling Binary Response\nSo far, we have modeled only quantitative response variables. The normal error regression model makes the assumption that the response variable is normally distributed, given the value(s) of the explanatory variables.\nNow, we’ll look at how to model a categorical response variable. We’ll consider only situations where the response is binary (i.e. has 2 categories). Problems with categorical response variables are sometimes called classification problems, while problems with numeric response variables are sometimes called regression problems.\n\n\n6.1.2 Credit Card Dataset\nWe’ll work with a dataset pertaining to 10,000 credit cards. The goal is to predict whether or not the user will default on the payment, using information on the credit card balance, user’s annual income, and whether or not the user is a student. Data come from Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani.\n\nlibrary(ISLR)\ndata(Default)\nsummary(Default)\n\n default    student       balance           income     \n No :9667   No :7056   Min.   :   0.0   Min.   :  772  \n Yes: 333   Yes:2944   1st Qu.: 481.7   1st Qu.:21340  \n                       Median : 823.6   Median :34553  \n                       Mean   : 835.4   Mean   :33517  \n                       3rd Qu.:1166.3   3rd Qu.:43808  \n                       Max.   :2654.3   Max.   :73554  \n\n\nDefault and Balance\nThe plot displays each person’s credit card balance on the x-axis, and whether or not they defaulted (a 0 or 1) on the y-axis.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x=balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) \n\n\n\n\nWe see that defaults are rare when the balance is less than $1,000, and more common for balances above $2,000.\nWe’ll first try fitting a linear regression model to the data to try to estimate the probability of a person defaulting on a loan, using the size of their balance as the explanatory variable.\n\n#convert default from yes/no to 0/1\nDefault$default &lt;- as.numeric(Default$default==\"Yes\") \n\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2)  + stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of problems with this model!\nIt allows the estimated probability of of default to be negative. It also assumes a linear trend that doesn’t seem to fit the data very well.\nA sigmoidal curve, like the one below, seems like a better model for default probabilities. This curve stays between 0 and 1, and its curved nature seems like a better fit for the data.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Logistic Regression Model\nA logistic regression model uses a sigmoidal curve like the one we saw to model default probabilities, using balance as an explanatory variable.\nThe model makes use of the function\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+x^x}, \\]\nwhose graph is shown below. This function is called an inverse logit function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with our linear model \\(E(Y_i) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\), we need to transform \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\) into the interval (0,1).\n\nLet \\(\\pi_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} }}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}}}\\).\nThen \\(0 \\leq \\pi_i \\leq 1\\), and \\(\\pi_i\\) represents an estimate of \\(P(Y_i=1)\\).\nThis function maps the values of \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}\\) into the interval (0,1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logistic regression model assumes that:\n\n\n\\(Y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\)\n\n\\(E(Y_i) = P(Y_i=1) = \\pi_i=\\frac{e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}}}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}}}\\) i.e. \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} + \\ldots \\beta_px_{ip}= \\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right).\\) (This is called the logit function and can be written \\(\\text{logit}(\\pi_i)\\).\n\nInstead of assuming that the expected response is a linear function of the explanatory variables, we are assuming that it is a function of a linear function of the explanatory variables.\nWe fit the logistic curve to the credit card data.\n\nggplot(data=Default, aes(y=default, x= balance)) + geom_point(alpha=0.2) + \n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) \n\n\n\n\nTo fit the logistic regression model in R, we use the function glm, instead of lm. The function is specified the same way as before, and we add family = binomial(link = \"logit\").\n\nCCDefault_M &lt;- glm(data=Default, default ~ balance, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\nsummary(CCDefault_M)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = default ~ balance, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), \n    data = Default)\n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate  Std.

Least squares does not work well in this generalized setting. Instead, the b’s are calculated using a more advanced technique, known as maximum likelihood estimation. We won’t say anything more about that topic here, but it is a prominent technique, widely used in statistic modeling. It is explored in more detail in advanced statistics courses, such as STAT 445:Mathematical Statistics."

The odds of a fair coin landing heads are \\(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}=1\\), sometimes written 1:1.\n\nThe odds of a fair 6-sided die landing on a 1 are \\(\\frac{1/6}{1-1/6}=\\frac{1}{5}\\), sometimes written 1:5.\n\nIn the credit card example, the odds of default are:\n\nFor a $1,000 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.005752145}{1-0.005752145} \\approx 1:173.\\)\nFor a $1,500 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.08294762 }{1-0.08294762 } \\approx 1:11.\\)\nFor a $2,000 balance - odds of default are \\(\\frac{0.5857694}{1-0.5857694} \\approx 1.414:1.\\)\n\nThe quantity \\(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}}{\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}}\\) is called the odds ratio and represents the odds ratio of a default for user \\(i\\), compared to user \\(j\\).\nExample:\nThe default odds ratio for a $1,000 payment, compared to a $2,000 payment is\nThe odds ratio is \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{173}}{\\frac{1.414}{1}}\\approx 1:244.\\)\nThe odds of a default are about 244 times larger for a $2,000 payment than a $1,000 payment.\n\n\n6.2.2 Interpretation of \\(\\beta_1\\)\nConsider the odds ratio for a case \\(j\\) with explanatory variable \\(x + 1\\), compared to case \\(i\\) with explanatory variable \\(x\\).\nThat is \\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\), and \\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1(x+1)\\).\n\\(\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}}{\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}}\\right)=\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_j}{1-\\pi_j}\\right)-\\text{log}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\right)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1(x+1)-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1(x))=\\beta_1.\\)\nFor every 1-unit increase in \\(x\\) we expect the log odds of “success” to multiply by a factor of \\(\\beta_1\\).\nFor every 1-unit increase in \\(x\\) we expect the odds of “success” to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\).\nInterpretation in Credit Card Example\n\\(b_1=0.0055\\)\nFor each 1-dollar increase in balance on the credit card., the odds of default are estimated to multiply by \\(e^{0.0055}\\approx1.0055\\).\nThat is, for each additional dollar on the card balance, the odds of default are estimated to increase by 0.55%\nFor each increase of \\(d\\) dollars in credit card balance, odds of default are estimated to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{0.0055d}\\).\nFor every $1,000 increase in balance, the odds of default are expected to multiply by a factor of \\(e^{0.0055\\times 1000}\\approx 244\\).\nThus, the odds of default for a balance of $2,000 are estimated to be \\(e^{0.0055\\times 1000}\\approx 244\\) times as great as the odds of default for a $1,000 balance. This matches our result when we actually calculated out the probabilities and odds.\nHypothesis test for \\(\\beta_1=0\\)\nThe p-value on the “balance” line of the regression output is associated with the null hypothesis \\(\\beta_1=0\\), that is that there is no relationship between balance and the odds of defaulting on the payment.\nThe fact that the p-value is so small tells us that there is strong evidence of a relationship between balance and odds of default.\nConfidence Intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\)\n\nconfint(CCDefault_M, level = 0.95)\n\n                    2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept) -11.383288936 -9.966565064\nbalance       0.005078926  0.005943365\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that for each 1 dollar increase in credit card balance, the odds of default are expected to multiply by a factor between \\(e^{0.00508}\\approx 1.0051\\) and \\(e^{0.00594}\\approx 1.0060\\).\nThis is a profile-likelihood interval, which you can read more about here."

    "section": "7.1 Modeling for Prediction",
    "text": "7.1 Modeling for Prediction\n\n7.1.1 Overview\nWe’ve previously learned how to build models for the purpose of interpretation, when our primary focus is on understanding relationships between variables in the model. In this chapter, we’ll examine how to build models for situations when we are not interested in understanding relationships between variables, and instead care only about making the most accurate predictions possible.\nWe’ve seen that when we model for interpretation, we encounter a tradeoff between model complexity and interpretability. We wanted to choose a model that is complex enough to reasonably approximate the structure of the underlying data, but at the same time, not so complicated that it becomes hard to interpret. When modeling for prediction, we don’t need to worry about interpretability, which can sometimes make more complex models more desirable. Nevertheless, we’ll encounter a different kind of tradeoff, involving model complexity, that we’ll have to think about, and we’ll see that more complex models do not always lead to better predictions.\nPredictive Modeling Vocabulary\n\nThe new data on which we make predictions is called test data.\nThe data used to fit the model is called training data.\n\nIn the training data, we know the values of the explanatory and response variables. In the test data, we know only the values of the explanatory variables and want to predict the values of the response variable.\n\n\n7.1.2 Illustration of Predictive Modeling\nThe illustration shows observations from a simulated dataset consisting of 100 observations of a single explanatory variable \\(x\\), and response variable \\(y\\). We want to find a model that captures the trend in the data and will be best able to predict new values of y, for given x.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll fit several different polynomial models to the data, increasing in complexity from the most simple model we could possibly use, a constant model, to a very complex eighth degree polynomial model.\nConstant Model to Sample Data\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Model to Sample Data\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic Model\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree 3, 4, and 8 Models\nWe continue exploring higher order polynomial models. The blue curve represents a third degree (cubic) polynomial model, while the red curve represents a fourth degree (quartic) model and the green represents an eighth degree model.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the flexibility of the model increases as we add higher-order terms. The curve is allowed to have more twists and bends. For higher-order, more complex models, individual points have more influence on the shape of the curve. This can be both a good and bad thing, as it allows the model to better bend and fit the data, but also makes it susceptible to the influence of outliers.\n\n\n7.1.3 Predicting New Data\nNow, suppose we have a new dataset of 100, x-values, and want to predict \\(y\\).

    "text": "7.2 Variance-Bias Tradeoff\n\n7.2.1 What Contributes to Prediction Error?\nSuppose \\(Y_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\).\nLet \\(\\hat{f}\\) represent the function of our explanatory variable(s) \\(x^*\\) used to predict the value of response variable \\(y^*\\). Thus \\(\\hat{y}^* = f(x^*)\\).\nThere are three factors that contribute to the expected value of \\(\\left(y^* - \\hat{y}\\right)^2 = \\left(y^* - \\hat{f}(x^*)\\right)^2\\).\n\nBias associated with fitting model: Model bias pertains to the difference between the true response function value \\(f(x^*)\\), and the average value of \\(\\hat{f}(x^*)\\) that would be obtained in the long run over many samples.\n\n\nfor example, if the true response function \\(f\\) is cubic, then using a constant, linear, or quadratic model would result in biased predictions for most values of \\(x^*\\).\n\nVariance associated with fitting model: Individual observations in the training data are subject to random sampling variability. The more flexible a model is, the more weight is put on each individual observation increasing the variance associated with the model.\nVariability associated with prediction: Even if we knew the true value \\(f(x^*)\\), which represents the expected value of \\(y^*\\) given \\(x=x^*\\), the actual value of \\(y^*\\) will vary due to random noise (i.e. the \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\\) term).\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Variance and Bias\nThe third source of variability cannot be controlled or eliminated. The first two, however are things we can control. If we could figure out how to minimize bias while also minimizing variance associated with a prediction, that would be great! But…\nThe constant model suffers from high bias. Since it does not include a linear, quadratic, or cubic term, it cannot accurately approximate the true regression function.\nThe Eighth degree model suffers from high variance. Although it could, in theory, approximate the true regression function correctly, it is too flexible, and is thrown off because of the influence of individual points with high degrees of variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Variance-Bias Tradeoff\nAs model complexity (flexibility) increases, bias decreases. Variance, however, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, it can be shown that:\n\\(\\text{Expected RMSPE} = \\text{Variance} + \\text{Bias}^2\\)\nOur goal is the find the “sweetspot” where expected RMSPE is minimized.\n\n\n7.2.4 Modeling for Prediction\n\nWhen our purpose is purely prediction, we don’t need to worry about keeping the model simple enough to interpret.\n\nGoal is to fit data well enough to make good predictions on new data without modeling random noise in the training (overfitting)\n\nA model that is too simple suffers from high bias\n\nA model that is too complex suffers from high variance and is prone to overfitting\n\nThe right balance is different for every dataset\n\nMeasuring error on data used to fit the model (training data) does not accurately predict how well model will be able to predict new data (test data)\n\n\n\n7.2.5 Cross-Validation\nWe’ve seen that training error is not an accurate approximation of test error. Instead, we’ll approximate test error, by setting aside a set of the training data, and using it as if it were a test set. This process is called cross-validation, and the set we put aside is called the validation set.\n\nPartition data into disjoint sets (folds). Approximately 5 folds recommended.\n\nBuild a model using 4 of the 5 folds.\n\nUse model to predict responses for remaining fold.\nCalculate root mean square error \\(RMSPE=\\displaystyle\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum((\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2)}{n'}}\\).\n\nRepeat for each of 5 folds.\n\nAverage RMSPE values across folds.\n\nIf computational resources permit, it is often beneficial to perform CV multiple times, using different sets of folds.\n\n\n7.2.6 Cross-Validation Illustration\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-schematic-illustration-of-K-fold-cross-validation-for-K-5-Original-dataset-shown_fig5_311668395\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.7 CV in R\nThe train function in the caret R package performs cross validation automatically. We’ll use it to compare five different models for house prices among a dataset of 1,000 houses sold in Ames, IA between 2006 and 2010.\nWe’ll consider six different models of (mostly) increasing complexity.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nTrain_Data &lt;- read_csv(\"Ames_Train_Data.csv\")  # Load data\nlibrary(caret)   # load caret package\n\n\n# set cross-validation settings - use 10 repeats of 10-fold CV\ncontrol &lt;- trainControl(method=\"repeatedcv\", number=10, repeats=10, savePredictions = \"all\" )\n\n# define models\n# set same random seed before each model to ensure same partitions are used in CV, making them comparable\n\nset.seed(10302023)   \nmodel1 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, \n                SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` ,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel2 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, \n                SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` +  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel3 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` + \n                  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area` + \n                  `Neighborhood` + `Bldg Type`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel4 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` \n                + `Gr Liv Area`  + `Garage Area` \n                + `Neighborhood` + `Bldg Type` + `Year Built`,  \n                method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel5 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ `Overall Qual` + \n                  `Gr Liv Area` + `Garage Area` + `Neighborhood` + \n                  `Bldg Type` + `Year Built` + I(`Overall Qual`^2) + \n                  I(`Gr Liv Area`^2) + I(`Garage Area`^2) + \n                  I(`Year Built`^2),  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\n\nset.seed(10302023) \nmodel6 &lt;- train(data=Train_Data, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)  # include everything linearly\n\n\n# Calculate RMSPE for each model\nRMSPE1 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model1$pred$obs-model1$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE2 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model2$pred$obs-model2$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE3 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model3$pred$obs-model3$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE4 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model4$pred$obs-model4$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE5 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model5$pred$obs-model5$pred$pred)^2))\nRMSPE6 &lt;- sqrt(mean((model6$pred$obs-model6$pred$pred)^2))\n\n\nRMSPE1\n\n[1] 51710.58\n\nRMSPE2\n\n[1] 44192.34\n\nRMSPE3\n\n[1] 38212.96\n\nRMSPE4\n\n[1] 38016.67\n\nRMSPE5\n\n[1] 38245.46\n\nRMSPE6\n\n[1] 40586.14\n\n\nWe see that in this case, model M4 performed the best on the hold-out data.

    "text": "7.3 Ridge Regression\n\n7.3.1 Complexity in Model Coefficients\nWe’ve thought about complexity in terms of the number of terms we include in a model, as well as whether we include quadratic terms and higher order terms and interactions.

Smaller values of \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are associated with less complex models.

in the model were 0, then we would be using the most simple constant model, and the prediction for the price of each house would be exactly the same as the overall mean. As \\(b_j's\\) get farther from 0, predictions begin move away from the overall mean and depend more and more on the values or categories of the explanatory variable(s) associated with individual houses. This creates a risk, however, of overfitting.\nA way to combat this, other than dropping variables from the model, is to shrink some or all of the regression coefficients closer to 0, pushing predictions closer to the overall mean.\nA statistical technique for doing this is called ridge regression.\n\n\n7.3.2 Ridge Regression Penalty\nWe’ve seen that in ordinary least-squares regression, \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) are chosen in a way that to minimizes\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}i)^2 =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x{i1} + b_2{x_i2} + \\ldots +b_px\\_{ip}))^2\n\\]\nWhen \\(p\\) is large and we want to be careful of overfitting, a common approach is to add a “penalty term” to this function, to incentive choosing values of \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) that are closer to 0, thereby “shrinking” the predictions toward the overall mean house price.\nSpecifically, we minimize:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\\\\ =  & \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is a pre-determined positive constant.\nLarger values of \\(b_j\\) typically help the model better fit the training data, thereby making the first term smaller, but also make the second term larger. The idea is the find optimal values of \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_p\\) that are large enough to allow the model to fit the data well, thus keeping the first term (SSR) small, while also keeping the penalty term small as well.\n\n\n7.3.3 Choosing \\(\\lambda\\)\nThe value of \\(\\lambda\\) is predetermined by the user. The larger the value of \\(\\lambda\\), the more heavily large \\(b_j's\\) are penalized. A value of \\(\\lambda=0\\) corresponds to ordinary least-squares.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ=& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat{y}_i)^2  + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\\\\ =  & \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + b_2x_{i2} + \\ldots + b_px_{ip}))^2 + \\lambda\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSmall values of \\(\\lambda\\) lead to more complex models, with larger \\(|b_j|\\)’s.\n\nAs \\(\\lambda\\) increases, \\(|b_j|\\)’s shrink toward 0. The model becomes less complex, thus bias increases, but variance decreases.\n\nWe can use cross validation to determine the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using ridge regression, it is important to standardize each explanatory variable (i.e. subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation). This ensures each variable has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Without standardizing the optimal choice of \\(b_j\\)’s would depend on scale, with variables with larger absolute measurements having more influence. We’ll standardize the response variable too. Though this is not strictly necessary, it doesn’t hurt. We can always transform back if necessary.\nStandardization is performed using the scale command in R.\n\nTrain_sc &lt;- Train_Data %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, scale)\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Ridge Regression on Housing Dataset\nWe’ll use the caret package to perform cross validation in order to find the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\). To use ridge regression, we specify method = \"glmnet\", and tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=0, lambda=l_vals). Note the alpha value can be changed to use other types of penalized regression sometimes used in predictive modeling, such as lasso or elastic net.\n\ncontrol = trainControl(\"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats=10)\nl_vals = 10^seq(-3, 3, length = 100)  # test values between 1/1000 and 1000\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_ridge &lt;- train(SalePrice ~ .,\n                       data = Train_sc, method = \"glmnet\", trControl=control , \n                      tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=0, lambda=l_vals))\n\nValue of \\(\\lambda\\) minimizing RMSPE:\n\nHousing_ridge$bestTune$lambda\n\n[1] 0.6135907\n\n\nWe examine RMSPE on the withheld data as a function of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing \\(\\lambda\\) = 0.6135907, obtain the following set of ridge regression coefficients.

    "text": "7.4 Decision Trees\n\n7.4.1 Basics of Decision Trees\nA decision tree is a flexible alternative to a regression model. It is said to be nonparametric because it does not involve parameters like \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots \\beta_p\\). A tree makes no assumption about the nature of the relationship between the response and explanatory variables, and instead allows us to learn this relationship from the data. A tree makes prediction by repeatedly grouping together like observations in the training data. We can make predictions for a new case, by tracing it through the tree, and averaging responses of training cases in the same terminal node.\nDecision Tree Example:\nWe fit a decision tree to the Ames Housing dataset, using the rpart function in a package by the same name.\n\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\ntree &lt;- rpart(SalePrice~., data=Train_Data, cp=0.04)\nrpart.plot(tree, box.palette=\"RdBu\", shadow.col=\"gray\", nn=TRUE, cex=1, extra=1)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the houses are first split based on whether or not their overall quality rating was less than 8. Each of the resulting nodes are then split again, using information from other explanatory variables. Each split partitions the data further, so that houses in the same node can be thought of as being similar to one another.\n\nThe predicted price of a House with overall quality 7, and was built in 1995 is $200,000.\nThe predicted price of a House overall quality 8 and 1,750 sq. ft. on the first floor is $370,000.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Partitioning in A Decision Tree\nFor a quantitative response variable, data are split into two nodes so that responses in the same node are as similar as possible, while responses in the different nodes are as different as possible.\nLet L and R represent the left and right nodes from a possible split. Let \\(n_L\\) and \\(n_R\\) represent the number of observations in each node, and \\(\\bar{y}_L\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_R\\) represent the mean of the training data responses in each node.\nFor each possible split, involving an explanatory variable, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\n\\]\nWe choose the split that minimizes this quantity.\nPartitioning Example\nConsider a dataset with two explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), and a response variable \\(y\\), whose values are shown numerically in the graph.\n\n\n   [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14]\nx1    8    2    8    1    8    6    2    5    1     8     4    10     9     8\nx2    5    3    1    1    4    3    8    1   10     8     6     5     0     2\ny   253   64  258   21  257  203  246  114  331   256   213   406   326   273\n   [,15]\nx1     6\nx2     1\ny    155\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to split up the data, using information about \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in a way that makes the \\(y\\) values grouped together as similar as possible.\n1. One Possible Split (\\(x_1 &lt; 5.5\\))\nWe could split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_1 &lt; 5.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calcuate the mean y-value in each resulting node:\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+21+64+114)/6 \\approx 164.84\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (203+155+256+253+257+273+258+326+406)/9 \\approx 265.22\\)\n\nTo measure measure the amount of deviation in the node, we calculate the sum of the squared difference between each individual value and the overall mean in each node.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-164.83)^2+(246-164.33)^2 + \\ldots+(114-164.33)^2 \\\\\n& =69958.83\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(203-265.22)^2+(155-265.22)^2 + \\ldots+(406-265.22)^2 \\\\\n& =39947.56\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAdding together these two quantities, we obtain an overall measure of the squared deviations between observations in the same node.\n\n69958.83 + 39947.56 = 109906.4\n\n2.Second Possible Split (\\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\))\nWe could alternatively split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this split,\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+21+64+114 + 203+155)/8 \\approx 168.375\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (256+253+257+273+258+326+406)/7 \\approx 289.857\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-168.375)^2+(246-168.375)^2 + \\ldots+(203-168.375)^2 \\\\\n& =71411.88\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(203-289.857)^2+(155-289.857)^2 + \\ldots+(406-289.857)^2 \\\\\n& =19678.86\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe total squared deviation is:\n\n71411.88 + 19678.86 = 91090.74\n\nThe split at \\(x1 &lt; 6.5\\) is better than \\(x_1&lt;5.5\\)\n3. Third Possible Split (\\(x_2 &lt; 5.5\\))\nWe could also split the data into 2 groups depending on whether \\(x_2 &lt; 5.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this split,\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_L = (331+246+213+256)/4 \\approx 261.5\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y}_R = (21 + 64 + \\ldots + 406)/11 \\approx 211.82\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2  \\\\\n& =(331-261.5)^2+(246-261.5)^2 + (213-261.5)^2+(256-261.5)^2 \\\\\n& =7453\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2 \\\\\n& =(21-211.82)^2+(64-211.82)^2 + \\ldots+(406-211.82)^2 \\\\\n& =131493.6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe sum of squared deviations is:\n\n7453 + 131493.6 = 138946.6\n\nComparison of Splits\n\nOf the three split’s we’ve calculated, \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\\) is minimized using \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\nIn fact, if we calculate all possible splits over \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_L} (y_i -\\bar{y}_L)^2 + \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_R} (y_i -\\bar{y}_R)^2\\) is minimized by splitting on \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\)\n\nThus, we perform the first split in the tree, using \\(x_1 &lt; 6.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Next Splits\nNext, we find the best splits on the resulting two nodes. It turns out that the left node is best split on \\(x_2 &lt; 4.5\\), and the right node is best split on \\(x_1 &lt; 8.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Recursive Partitioning\nSplitting continues until nodes reach a certain predetermined minimal size, or until change improvement in model fit drops below a predetermined value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.5 Model Complexity in Trees\nThe more we partition data into smaller nodes, the more complex the model becomes. As we continue to partition, bias decreases, as cases are grouped with those that are more similar to themselves. On the other hand, variance increases, as there are fewer cases in each node to be averaged, putting more weight on each individual observation.\nSplitting into too small of nodes can lead to drastic overfitting. In the extreme case, if we split all the way to nodes of size 1, we would get RMSE of 0 on the training data, but should certainly not expect RMSPE of 0 on the test data.\nThe optimal depth of the tree, or minimal size for terminal nodes can be determined using cross-validation. The rpart package uses a complexity parameter cp, which determines how much a split must improve model fit in order to be made. Smaller values of cp are associated with more complex tree models, since they allow splits even when model fit only improves by a little.\n\n\n7.4.6 Cross-Validation on Housing Data\nWe’ll use caret to determine the optimal value of the cp parameter. We use method=\"rpart\" to grow decision trees.\n\ncp_vals = 10^seq(-8, 1, length = 100) # test values between 1/10^8 and 1\ncolnames(Train_sc) &lt;- make.names(colnames(Train_sc))\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_Tree &lt;- train(data=Train_sc, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"rpart\", trControl=control, \n                     tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=cp_vals))\n\nThe optimal value of cp is:\n\nHousing_Tree$bestTune\n\n             cp\n52 0.0004328761\n\n\nWe plot RMSPE on the holdout data as a function of cp.\n\ncp &lt;- Housing_Tree$results$cp\nRMSPE &lt;- Housing_Tree$results$RMSE\nggplot(data=data.frame(cp, RMSPE), aes(x=cp, y=RMSPE))+geom_line() + xlim(c(0,0.001)) + ylim(c(0.475,0.485))  + \n  ggtitle(\"Regression Tree Cross Validation Results\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.7 Comparing OLS, Lasso, Ridge, and Tree\n\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_OLS &lt;- train(data=Train_sc, SalePrice ~ .,  method=\"lm\", trControl=control)\nset.seed(11162020)\nHousing_lasso &lt;- train(SalePrice ~., data = Train_sc, method = \"glmnet\", trControl=control, \n                      tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=1, lambda=l_vals))\n\nRMSPE on the standardized version of the response variable is displayed below for ordinary least squares, ridge regression, lasso regression, and a decision tree.\n\nmin(Housing_OLS $results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.5634392\n\nmin(Housing_ridge$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.4570054\n\nmin(Housing_lasso$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.4730672\n\nmin(Housing_Tree$results$RMSE)\n\n[1] 0.477414\n\n\nIn this situation, the tree outperforms OLS, but does not do as well as lasso or ridge. The best model will vary depending on the nature of the data. We can use cross-validation to determine which model is likely to perform best in prediction.\n\n\n7.4.8 Random Forest\nA popular extension of a decision tree is a random forest. A random forest consists of many (often ~10,000) trees. Predictions are made by averaging predictions from individual trees.\n\nIn order to ensure the trees are different from each other:\n\neach tree is grown from a different bootstrap sample of the training data.\n\nwhen deciding on a split, only a random subset of explanatory variables are considered.\n\n\nGrowing deep trees ensures low bias. In a random forest, averaging across many deep trees decreases variance, while maintaining low bias."

On the other hand, the tree estimates only a 0.16 probability of the second person defaulting, compared to 0.26 for the logistic regression model.\n\n\n7.7.3 Assessing Classifier Accuracy\nWe’ve seen \\(\\text{RMSPE} = \\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}}\\) used as a measure of predictive accuracy in a regression problem.\nSince our outcome is not numeric, this is not a good measure of predictive accuracy in a classification problem. We’ll examine some alternatives we can use instead.\nClassification Accuracy\nOne simple approach is calculate the proportion of credit card users classified correctly. If a person has model estimates a predicted probability of default greater than 0.5, the person is predicted to default, while if the probability estimate is less than 0.5, the person is predicted to not default.\nThe table shows the prediction for each of the 10 users, using both logistic regression and the decision tree.\n\nLR_Pred &lt;- factor(ifelse(LR_Prob &gt; 0.5, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\nTree_Pred &lt;- factor(ifelse(Tree_Prob &gt; 0.5, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\nLR_Res_df &lt;- data.frame(student, balance, LR_Prob, Tree_Prob, LR_Pred,Tree_Pred, Actual_Default)\nkable(head(LR_Res_df, 50)%&gt;% arrange(desc(LR_Prob)) %&gt;% head(10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudent\nbalance\nLR_Prob\nTree_Prob\nLR_Pred\nTree_Pred\nActual_Default\n\n\n\n\n2465\nYes\n2026.864\n0.54\n0.77\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\n1228\nNo\n1682.201\n0.26\n0.16\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6656\nNo\n1551.028\n0.14\n0.16\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n1185\nNo\n1541.813\n0.13\n0.16\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9963\nYes\n1635.175\n0.12\n0.16\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6635\nNo\n1434.128\n0.07\n0.01\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n9691\nNo\n1391.318\n0.06\n0.01\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5921\nYes\n1513.542\n0.06\n0.16\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9755\nNo\n1233.619\n0.02\n0.01\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7569\nYes\n1294.286\n0.02\n0.01\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that although the probabilities differ, the logistic regression model and classification tree give the same predictions for these ten cases. Both correctly predict 8 out of the 10 cases, but mistakenly predict the first person to default, when they didn’t, and mistakenly predict that the sixth person would not default when they did.\nWe’ll check the classification accuracy for the model and the tree.\n\nsum(LR_Pred == Actual_Default)/1000\n\n[1] 0.972\n\n\n\nsum(Tree_Pred == Actual_Default)/1000\n\n[1] 0.971\n\n\nWe see that the two techniques are each right approximately 97% of the time.\nThis may not really be as good as it sounds. Can you think of a very simple classification strategy that would achieve a similarly impressive predictive accuracy on these data?\n\n\n7.7.4 Confusion Matrix\nIn addition to assessing overall accuracy, it is sometimes helpful to assess how well models are able to predict outcomes in each class. For example, how accurately can a model detect people who do actually default on their payments?\nA confusion matrix is a two-by-two table displaying the number of cases predicted in each category as columns, and the number of cases actually in each category as rows\n\n\n\n\nActually Negative\nActually Positive\n\n\n\n\nPredicted Negative\n# True Negative\n# False Negative\n\n\nPredicted Positive\n# False Positive\n# True Positive\n\n\n\nThe confusionMatrix matrix command in R returns the confusion matrix for all 1,000 test cases.\nLet’s look at the confusion matrix for all 1,000 test cases. The data argument is the predicted outcome, and the reference argument is the true outcome. The positive argument is the category that we’ll classify as a positive.\nLogistic Regression Confusion Matrix\n\nconfusionMatrix(data=LR_Pred, reference=factor(Actual_Default) , positive=\"Yes\")\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  No Yes\n       No  957  20\n       Yes   8  15\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.972           \n                 95% CI : (0.9598, 0.9813)\n    No Information Rate : 0.965           \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.12988         \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.5035          \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.03764         \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.4286          \n            Specificity : 0.9917          \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.6522          \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.9795          \n             Prevalence : 0.0350          \n         Detection Rate : 0.0150          \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.0230          \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.7101          \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : Yes             \n                                          \n\n\nOut of 965 people who did not default, the logistic regression model correctly predicted 957 of them.\nOut of 35 people that did default, the model correctly predicted 15 of them.\nTree Confusion Matrix\n\n# data is predicted class\n# reference is actual class\nconfusionMatrix( data = Tree_Pred , reference= Actual_Default, \"Yes\")\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  No Yes\n       No  960  24\n       Yes   5  11\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.971           \n                 95% CI : (0.9586, 0.9805)\n    No Information Rate : 0.965           \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.1724819       \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.4186          \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.0008302       \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.3143          \n            Specificity : 0.9948          \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.6875          \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.9756          \n             Prevalence : 0.0350          \n         Detection Rate : 0.0110          \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.0160          \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.6546          \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : Yes             \n                                          \n\n\nOut of 965 people who did not default, the logistic regression model correctly predicted 960 of them.\nOut of 35 people that did default, the model correctly predicted 11 of them.\nNotice that the tree was less likely to predict a person to default in general, returning only 16 positive predictions, compared to 23 for the logistic regression model.\n\n\n7.7.5 Sensitivity and Specificity\nThe sensitivity of a classifier is the proportion of all positive cases that the model correctly identifies as positive. (i.e. probability model says “positive” given actually is positive.)\n\\[\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive} + \\text{False Negative}} = \\frac{\\text{Correctly Predicted Positives}}{\\text{Total Number of Actual Positives}}\n\\]\nLR Sensitivity\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{15+20} \\approx 0.4286\n\\]\nTree Sensitivity\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{11+24} \\approx 0.3143\n\\]\nThe specificity of a classifier is the proportion of all negative cases that the model correctly identifies as negative (i.e probabiltiy model says “negative” given truly is negative.)\n\\[\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{True Negative}}{\\text{True Negative} + \\text{False Positive}}= \\frac{\\text{Correctly Predicted Negatives}}{\\text{Total Number of Actual Negatives}}\n\\]\nLR Specificity\n\\[\\frac{957}{957+8} \\approx 0.9917\\]\nTree Specificity\n\\[\\frac{960}{960+5} \\approx 0.9948 \\]\nIn a given situation, we should think about the cost of a false negative vs a false positive when determining whether to place more weight on sensitivity or specificity. For example, “is it worse to tell a patient they tested positive for a disease when they really don’t have it, or to not tell them they tested positive when they really do have it?”"

These techniques treat a 0.49 estimated probability of default the same as a 0.01 estimated probability.\nWe would hope to see more defaults among people with high estimated default probabilities than low ones. To assess this, we can list the people in order from highest to lowest probability estimates and see where the true defaults lie.\nFor example, consider the following fictional probability estimates produced by two different classifiers (models) for eight credit card users:\nClassifier 1\n\n\n  Classifier1_Probability_Estimate True_Outcome\n1                             0.90          Yes\n2                             0.75          Yes\n3                             0.60           No\n4                             0.40          Yes\n5                             0.30           No\n6                             0.15           No\n7                             0.05           No\n8                             0.01           No\n\n\nClassifier 2\n\n\n  Classifier2_Probability_Estimate True_Outcome\n1                             0.80          Yes\n2                             0.70           No\n3                             0.55           No\n4                             0.40          Yes\n5                             0.35           No\n6                             0.15           No\n7                             0.10          Yes\n8                             0.02           No\n\n\nClassifier 1 is better able to separate the “Yes’s” from “No’s” as the three true “Yes’s” are among the four highest probabilities. Classifier 2 is less able to separate the true “Yes’s” from true “No’s.”\n\n\n7.8.2 ROC Curve\nA receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve tells us how well a predictor is able to separate positive cases from negative cases.\nThe blog (Toward Data Science) [https://towardsdatascience.com/applications-of-different-parts-of-an-roc-curve-b534b1aafb68] writes\n“Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is one of the most common graphical tools to diagnose the ability of a binary classifier, independent of the inherent classification algorithm. The ROC analysis has been used in many fields including medicine, radiology, biometrics, natural hazards forecasting, meteorology, model performance assessment, and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research [1]. If you are a Data Scientist, you might be using it on a daily basis.”\nThe ROC curve plots the true positive (or hit) rate against the false positive rate (false alarm) rate, as the cutoff for a positive classification varies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher the curve, the better the predictor is able to separate positive cases from negative ones.\nPredictions made totally at random would be expected to yield a diagonal ROC curve.\n\n\n7.8.3 Constructing ROC Curve\n\nOrder the probabilities from highest to lowest.\n\nAssume only the case with the highest probability is predicted as a positive.\n\nCalculate the true positive rate (hit rate) \\[\\frac{\\text{\\# True Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Positives}}\\] and false positive (false alarm) \\[\\frac{\\text{\\# False Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Negatives}}\\]rate.\nPlot the point \\[\\left( \\frac{\\text{\\# False Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Negatives}}, \\frac{\\text{\\# True Positives}}{\\text{\\# Actual Positives}} \\right)\\] in the coordinate plane.\n\nNow assume the cases with the two highest probabilities are predicted as positives, and repeat steps 3-4.\n\nContinue, by classifiying one more case as positive in each step.\n\n\n\n7.8.4 Construct ROC Example\nLet’s practice constructing an ROC curve for a small set of probability estimates.\n\nprob &lt;- c(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.65, 0.45, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05)\nActual &lt;- c(\"+\", \"-\", \"+\", \"+\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"+\", \"-\")\nHit_Rate &lt;- c(\"1/4\", \"1/4\", \"2/4\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\")\nFA_Rate &lt;- c(\"0/6\", \"1/6\", \"1/6\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\")\nkable(data.frame(prob, Actual, Hit_Rate, FA_Rate))\n\n\n\n\nprob\nActual\nHit_Rate\nFA_Rate\n\n\n\n\n0.90\n+\n1/4\n0/6\n\n\n0.80\n-\n1/4\n1/6\n\n\n0.70\n+\n2/4\n1/6\n\n\n0.65\n+\n\n\n\n\n0.45\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.30\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.20\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.15\n-\n\n\n\n\n0.10\n+\n\n\n\n\n0.05\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish filling in the table and sketch a graph of the resulting ROC curve.\nQuestion: If the probability estimate of 0.45 were instead 0.5 or 0.55, would this change the ROC curve? Why or why not?\n\n\n7.8.5 AUC\nThe area under the ROC curve, (AUC) provides a measure of the model’s predictive strength.\nWhile there is no standard for what constitutes a good\" AUC, higher is better, andAUC” is useful for comparing models.\nA model that can perfectly separate successes from failures will have an AUC of 1.\nA model that assigns probabilities at random is expected to have an AUC of 0.5.\n\n\n7.8.6 LR and Tree ROC Curves\n\nlibrary(pROC)\nlibrary(verification)\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default, pred = LR_Prob)\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default, predictor = LR_Prob)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.8953\n\n\n\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default, pred = Tree_Prob)\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default, predictor = Tree_Prob)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.8176\n\n\n\nRandProb &lt;- runif(1000, 0, 1)\n\n\nroc.plot(x=Default_Test$default, pred = RandProb)\n\n\n\n\n\nauc(response=Default_Test$default, predictor = RandProb)\n\nArea under the curve: 0.563\n\n\nEven though a model that assigns predictions randomly, with 97% predicted as negatives will have a high accuracy rate, it will yield a poor ROC curve indicating an inability to separate positive cases from negative ones."

It could then be used to predict ratings of future job applicants.\nAccording to [Reuters])(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G),\n“In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word “women’s,” as in “women’s chess club captain.” And it downgraded graduates of two all-women’s colleges, according to people familiar with the matter.”\nWhile the algorithm was intended to predict candidate quality, the response variable on the training data actually reflected biases in past hiring decisions, leading the algorithm to do the same.\n\n\n7.9.3 Facial Recognition\nFacial recognition technology is used by law enforcement surveillance, airport passenger screening, and employment and housing decisions. It has, however, been banned for use by police in some cities, including San Francisco and Boston, due to concerns about inequity and privacy.\nResearch has shown that although certain facial recognition algorithms achieve over 90% accuracy overall, accuracy rate is lower among subjects who are female, Black, or 18-30 years old.\nThis is likely due, at least in part, to the algorithms being trained primarily on data an images of people who are not members of these groups.\nAlthough the algorithms might attain strong accuracy overall, it is inappropriate to evaluate them on this basis, without accounting for performance on subgroups in the population.\n\n\n7.9.4 Comments\nThe biases and assumptions noted above are not reasons to abandon predictive modeling, but rather flaws to be aware of and work to correct.\nPredictive algorithms, are only as good as the data on which they are trained and the societies in which they are developed, and will reflect inherent biases. Thus, they should be used cautiously and with with human judgment, just like any other statistical technique.\nBeware of statements like:\n“The data say this!”\n“The algorithm is objective.”\n“The numbers don’t lie.”\nAny data-driven analysis depends on assumptions, and sound judgment and awareness of context are required when assessing the validaty of conclusions drawn.\n\n\n7.9.5 Modeling for Prediction\n\nGoal is to make the most accurate predictions possible.\n\nNot concerned with understanding relationships between variables. Not worried model being to complicated to interpret, as long as it yields good predictions.\n\nAim for a model that best captures the signal in the data, without being thrown off by noise.\n\n\nLarge number of predictors is ok\n\nDon’t make model so complicated that it overfits the data.\n\n\nBe sure that model is predicting what you intend it to\n\nReflective of biases inherent in the data on which it was trained"
